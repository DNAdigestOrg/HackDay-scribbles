EGAS00000000029,Massive Genomic Rearrangment Acquired in a Single Catastrophic Event During Cancer Development,"Cancer is driven by mutation. Using Agilent exome hybridisation capture and Illumina GA massively parallel sequencing technology, we aim to sequence ~1600 microRNAs plus the protein coding genome of 25 matched human renal cancer samples. Bespoke algorithms are being developed to identify the somatically acquired point mutations, insertions and deletions in these samples. This project will give unprecedented insights into mutational processes, cellular repair pathways and gene networks associated with renal cancer development.Agilent whole exome hybridisation capture will be performed on genomic DNA derived from 25 renal cancers and matched normal DNA from the same patients. Three lanes of Illumina GA sequencing will be performed on the resulting 50 exome libraries and mapped to build 37 of the human reference genome to facilitate the identification of novel cancer genes.

The genome sequence, detailed information of genetic variations between individuals, high-throughput molecular technologies and novel statistical strategies create new possibilities to define genetic and life-style risk factors behind common health problems. Studies of large population cohorts are needed to transform the genetic information to detailed understanding of the predisposing factors in diseases affecting most human populations. European twin cohorts provide a unique competitive advantage for investigations of the role of genetics and environment or life style in the etiology of common diseases. This project will apply and develop new molecular and statistical strategies to analyze unique European twin and other population cohorts to define and characterise the genetic, environmental and life-style components in the background of health problems like obesity, migraine, coronary heart disease and stroke, representing major health care problems worldwide.

EGAS00000000051,A small cell lung cancer genome reports complex tobacco exposure signatures,"Cancer is driven by mutation. Worldwide, tobacco smoking is the major lifestyle exposure that causes cancer, exerting carcinogenicity through 60 chemicals that bind and mutate DNA. Using massively parallel sequencing technology, we sequenced a small cell lung cancer cell line, NCI-H209, to explore the mutational burden associated with tobacco smoking. 22,910 somatic substitutions were identified, including 132 in coding exons. Multiple mutation signatures testify to the cocktail of carcinogens in tobacco smoke and their proclivities for particular bases and surrounding sequence context. Effects of transcription-coupled repair and a second, more general expression-linked repair pathway were evident. We identified a tandem duplication that duplicates exons 3-8 of CHD7 in-frame, and another two lines carrying PVT1-CHD7 fusion genes, suggesting that CHD7 may be recurrently rearranged in this disease. These findings illustrate the potential for next-generation sequencing to provide unprecedented insights into mutational processes, cellular repair pathways and gene networks associated with cancer.

The genetic determinants of the Lp(a) lipoprotein level and their relevance for the risk of coronary disease are incompletely understood. METHODS: We used a novel gene chip containing 48,742 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 2100 candidate genes to test for associations in 3145 case subjects with coronary disease and 3352 control subjects. Replication was tested in three independent populations involving 4846 additional case subjects with coronary disease and 4594 control subjects. RESULTS: Three chromosomal regions (6q26-27, 9p21, and 1p13) were strongly associated with the risk of coronary disease. The LPA locus on 6q26-27 encoding Lp(a) lipoprotein had the strongest association. We identified a common variant (rs10455872) at the LPA locus with an odds ratio for coronary disease of 1.70 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.49 to 1.95) and another independent variant (rs3798220) with an odds ratio of 1.92 (95% CI, 1.48 to 2.49). Both variants were strongly associated with an increased level of Lp(a) lipoprotein, a reduced copy number in LPA (which determines the number of kringle IV-type 2 repeats), and a small Lp(a) lipoprotein size. Replication studies confirmed the effects of both variants on the Lp(a) lipoprotein level and the risk of coronary disease. A meta-analysis showed that with a genotype score involving both LPA SNPs, the odds ratios for coronary disease were 1.51 (95% CI, 1.38 to 1.66) for one variant and 2.57 (95% CI, 1.80 to 3.67) for two or more variants. After adjustment for the Lp(a) lipoprotein level, the association between the LPA genotype score and the risk of coronary disease was abolished. CONCLUSIONS: We identified two LPA variants that were strongly associated with both an increased level of Lp(a) lipoprotein and an increased risk of coronary disease. Our findings provide support for a causal role of Lp(a) lipoprotein in coronary disease.

EGAS00000000056,Identification of cis- and trans-regulatory variation modulating microRNA expression levels in human fibroblasts,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are regulatory noncoding RNAs that affect the production of a significant fraction of human mRNAs via post-transcriptional regulation. Interindividual variation of the miRNA expression levels is likely to influence the expression of miRNA target genes and may therefore contribute to phenotypic differences in humans, including susceptibility to common disorders. The extent to which miRNA levels are genetically controlled is largely unknown. In this report, we assayed the expression levels of miRNAs in primary fibroblasts from 180 European newborns of the GenCord project and performed association analysis to identify eQTLs (expression quantitative traits loci). We detected robust expression for 121 miRNAs out of 365 interrogated. We have identified significant cis- (10%) and trans- (11%) eQTLs.

EGAS00000000064,The patterns and dynamics of genomic instability in metastatic pancreatic cancer,"Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive malignancy with a five-year mortality of 97â€“98%, usually due to widespread metastatic disease. Previous studies indicate that this disease has a complex genomic landscape, with frequent copy number changes and point mutations, but genomic rearrangements have not been characterized in detail. Despite the clinical importance of metastasis, there remain fundamental questions about the clonal structures of metastatic tumours, including phylogenetic relationships among metastases, the scale of ongoing parallel evolution in metastatic and primary sites, and how the tumour disseminates. Here we harness advances in DNA sequencing to annotate genomic rearrangements in 13 patients with pancreatic cancer and explore clonal relationships among metastases. We find that pancreatic cancer acquires rearrangements indicative of telomere dysfunction and abnormal cell-cycle control, namely dysregulated G1-to-S-phase transition with intact G2â€“M checkpoint. These initiate amplification of cancer genes and occur predominantly in early cancer development rather than the later stages of the disease. Genomic instability frequently persists after cancer dissemination, resulting in ongoing, parallel and even convergent evolution among different metastases. We find evidence that there is genetic heterogeneity among metastasis-initiating cells, that seeding metastasis may require driver mutations beyond those required for primary tumours, and that phylogenetic trees across metastases show organ-specific branches. These data attest to the richness of genetic variation in cancer, brought about by the tandem forces of genomic instability and evolutionary selection.",EGAD00000000052,Title not provided,Sequencing data from natching Pancreatic Carcinoma samples, Illumina Genome Analyzer II

We investigated the utility of massively parallel sequencing to characterize an adenocarcinoma of the tongue, before and after treatment. 
                        Results - In the pre-treatment tumor we identified 7,629 genes within regions of copy number gain. 1,078 genes exhibited increased expression relative to the blood and unrelated tumors and four genes contained somatic protein-coding mutations. Our analysis suggested the tumor cells were driven by the RET oncogene. Genes whose protein products are targeted by the RET inhibitors sunitinib and sorafenib correlated with being amplified and or highly expressed. Consistent with our observations administration of sunitinib was associated with stable disease lasting 4 months, after which the lung lesions began to grow.  Administration of sorafenib and sulindac provided disease stabilization for an additional 3 months after which the cancer progressed and new lesions appeared. A recurring metastasis possessed 7,288 genes within copy number amplicons, 385 genes exhibiting increased expression relative to other tumours and 9 new somatic protein coding mutations. The observed mutations and amplif
                        ications were  consistent with therapeutic resistance arising through activation of the MAPK and AKT pathways. Conclusions - We conclude that complete genomic characterization of a rare tumour has the potential to aid in clinical decision making and identifying therapeutic approaches where no established treatment protocols exist.  These results also provide direct in-vivo genomic evidence for mutational evolution within a tumor under drug selection and potential mechanisms of drug resistance accrual.

Array-CGH and expression analyses of 1172 primary breast tumours revealed that ZNF703 was the single gene within the minimal amplicon and was amplified predominantly in the Luminal B subtype. Amplification was shown to correlate with increased gene and protein expression and was associated with a distinct expression signature and poor clinical outcome. ZNF703 transformed NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, behaving as a classical oncogene, and regulated proliferation in human luminal breast cancer cell lines and immortalized human mammary epithelial cells. Manipulation of ZNF703 expression in the luminal MCF7 cell line modified the effects of TGFÎ² on proliferation. Overexpression of ZNF703 in normal human breast epithelial cells enhanced the frequency of in vitro colony-forming cells from luminal progenitors.

Unsupervised analysis of paired DNA/RNA profiles revealed novel subgroups

EGAS00000000083,METABRIC,"The elucidation of breast cancer subgroups and their molecular drivers
requires integrated views of the genome and transcriptome from
representative numbers of patients. We present an integrated analysis of
copy number and gene expression in a discovery and validation
set of 997 and 995 primary breast tumours, respectively, with long-term
clinical follow-up. Inherited variants (CNVs, SNPs) and acquired somatic
copy number aberrations (CNAs) were associated with expression in  40% of
genes, although the landscape was dominated by cis and trans-acting CNAs. By
delineating expression outlier genes driven in cis by CNAs, we identified
putative cancer genes, including deletions in PPP2R2A, MTAP, and MAP2K4.
Unsupervised analysis of paired DNA/RNA profiles revealed novel subgroups
with distinct clinical outcomes, which reproduced in the validation cohort.
These include a high-risk, ER-positive 11q13/14 cis-acting subgroup and a
favourable prognosis subgroup devoid of CNAs. Trans-acting aberration
0152hotspots were found to modulate subgroup-specific gene networks, including
a TCR deletion-mediated adaptive immune response in the 0152CNA-devoid

We provide genome-wide association results for 62,553 people of European ancestry using up to 2,644,161 autosomal SNPs. Participants with extreme measurements (>+/-3SD from mean) were excluded on a per phenotype basis. Imputation was done using haplotypes from HapMap Phase 2. SNP associations with each phenotype were tested by linear regression using an additive genetic model. Associations were tested separately in each cohort, with principal components and other study specific factors as covariates to account of population substructure. We then carried out meta-analysis of results from the individual cohorts using z-scores weighted by square root of sample size. SNPs with MAF<1% (weighted average across cohorts) were removed, as were SNPs with weight <50% of phenotype sample size.

We find oncogenic mutations in cancer genes not previously implicated in myeloma, including SF3B1, PI3KCA and PTEN. We define diverse processes contributing to the mutational repertoire, including kataegis and somatic hypermutation. Most cases have at least one cluster of subclonal variants, including subclonal driver mutations, implying on-going tumor evolution. Serial samples revealed diverse patterns of clonal evolution, including linear evolution, differential clonal response and branching evolution.

These processes operate over levels ranging from individual exons to whole chromosomes, often generating correlated copy number alterations across hundreds of linked genes. An example of the latter is the 2% of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) characterized by recurrent intrachromosomal amplification of megabase regions of chromosome 21 (iAMP21)7,8  To dissect the interplay between mutational processes and selection on this scale, we used genomic, cytogenetic and transcriptional analysis, coupled with novel bioinformatic approaches, to reconstruct the evolution of iAMP21 ALL. We find that individuals born with the rare constitutional Robertsonian translocation between chromosomes 15 and 21, rob(15;21)(q10;q10)c, have ~2700-fold increased risk of developing iAMP21 ALL compared to the general population. In such cases, amplification is initiated by chromothripsis involving both sister chromatids of the dicentric Robertsonian chromosome. In contrast, sporadic iAMP21 is typically initiated by breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) events, often followed by chromothripsis or other rearrangements. In both sporadic and iAMP21 in rob(15;21)c individuals, the final stages of amplification frequently involve large-scale duplications of the abnormal chromosome. The end-product is a derivative chromosome 21 or a derivative originating from the rob(15;21)c chromosome, der(15;21), respectively, with gene dosage optimised for leukemic potential, showing constrained copy number levels over multiple linked genes. In summary, the constitutional translocation, rob(15;21)c, predisposes to leukemia through a novel mechanism, namely a propensity to undergo chromothripsis, likely related to its dicentric nature. More generally, our data illustrate that several cancer-specific mutational processes, applied sequentially, can co-ordinate to fashion copy number profiles over large genomic scales, incrementally refining the fitness benefits of aggregated gene dosage changes.", Illumina HiSeq 2000;

An unexplored alternative to such genetic determination concerns epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation. CpG islands (CGIs) are generally constitutively hypomethylated, however there are circumstances in which they become heavily methylated and, when coincident with a gene promoter, this invariably causes transcriptional silencing. CGI methylation occurs in normal tissues during processes such as X-inactivation, but abnormal patterns of methylation have also been implicated in disease. The vast majority of evidence relates to cancer, where silencing of multiple genes in this way appears to be a causal contributor to the cancer state.

The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) is a two-generation prospective study. Pregnant women living in one of three health districts in the former county of Avon with an expected delivery date between April 1991 and December 1992 were eligible to be enrolled in the study, and this formed the initial point of contact for the development of a large, family based resource.

EGAS00001000096,Identification of improved IL28B SNPs and haplotypes for prediction of drug response in treatment of hepatitis C using massively parallel sequencing in a cross-sectional European cohort,"The hepatitis C virus infects nearly 3% of the Worldâ€™s population, causing severe liver
disease in many. Standard of care therapy is currently pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin
(PegIFN/R), which is effective in less than half of those infected with the most common viral genotype. Two IL28B SNPs, rs8099917 and rs12979860, predict response to (PegIFN/R) therapy in treatment of hepatitis C virus infection. These SNPs were identified in genome wide analyses using Illumina genotyping chips. In people of European ancestry, there are 6 common (>1%) haplotypes for IL28B, one tagged by rs8099917 minor allele, four tagged by rs12979860.
We used massive parallel sequencing of the IL28B and IL28A gene regions generated by PCR 
from pooled DNA samples from 100 responders and 99 non-responders to therapy, to identify
common variants. Variants that had high odds ratios and were validated were then genotyped
in a cohort of 905 responders and non-responders. Their predictive power was assessed, alone
and in combination with HLA-C. Only SNPs in the IL28B linkage disequilibrium block predicted drug response. Eighteen
SNPs were identified with evidence for association with drug response, and with a high degree of confidence in the sequence call.
We found that two SNPs, rs4803221 (homozygote minor allele positive predictive value (PPV) of 77%) and rs7248668 (PPV 78%), predicted 
failure to respond better than the current best, rs8099917 (PPV 73%) and rs12979860 (PPV
68%) in this cross-sectional cohort. The best SNPs tagged a single common haplotype, haplotype 2. Genotypes predicted lack of response better than alleles.
However, combination of IL28B haplotype 2 carrier status with the HLA-C C2C2 genotype, which has previousl y
been reported to improve prediction in combination with IL28B, provides the highest PPV
(80%). The haplotypes present alternative putative transcription factor binding and
methylation sites. Massive parallel sequencing allowed identification and comparison of the best common SNPs 
for identifying treatment failure in therapy for HCV SNPs tagging a single haplotype have
the highest PPV, especially in combination with HLA-C. The functional basis for the association may be due to altered regulation of the gene.
These approaches have utility in improving diagnostic testing and identifying causal haplotypes or SNPs.",EGAD00001000032,Hepatitis C IL28B pooled resequencing study with 100 responders and 100 non-responders,Hepatitis C IL28B pooled resequencing study with 100 responders and 100 non-responders, Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx

Ocular coloboma is the most common significant developmental eye defect with an incidence of ~1 in 5,000 live births. It results from failure of optic fissure closure during embryogenesis. The position and extent of the fusion failure dictates the clinical appearance and functional effect. ~30% of coloboma cases are associated with other systemic malformations. These UK10K samples will mostly comprise isolated coloboma cases without systemic involvement (aka non-syndromal coloboma). There is strong evidence from family studies that coloboma has a major genetic component with autosomal dominance being the most common pattern of inheritance. However, many cases are isolated or show complex patterns of familial clustering. The genes responsible for isolated coloboma are largely unknown, but in a small number of families mutations in SHH, CHX10, and PAX6 have been identified indicating marked genetic heterogeneity. Thus in addition to the clinical benefits of achieving a molecular diagnosis there are also major scientific advantages to identifying coloboma genes, as these are likely to provide insights into the complex process of optic fissure closure, that is critical to normal eye development. In the longer term, understanding the molecular basis of the disease may provide clues to therapeutic strategies.For further information with regard to this cohort please contact David Fitzpatrick (david.fitzpatrick@ed.ac.uk).",EGAD00001000307,UK10K_RARE_COLOBOMA REL-2012-11-27,UK10K_RARE_COLOBOMA REL-2012-11-27," Illumina Genome Analyzer II;, Illumina HiSeq 2000;"

Integration with matched whole transcriptome sequence data revealed that only 36% of mutations are expressed.  By examining single nucleotide variant (SNV) allelic abundance derived from deep re-sequencing (median > 20,000 fold) measurements in 2414 somatic mutations, we determine for the first time in an epithelial tumour, the relative abundance of clonal genotypes among cases in the population. We show that TNBC vary widely and continuously in their clonal frequencies at the time of diagnosis, with basal subtype TNBC exhibiting more variation than non-basal TNBC. Although p53 and  somatic mutations appear clonally dominant compared with other pathways, in some tumours their clonal frequencies are incompatible with founder status.

Cost implications dictate a pooled DNA sequencing design, evaluation of allele frequency differences based on the resequenced samples and large-scale targeted follow-up in further samples.

EGAS00001000135,Recurrent somatic DICER1 mutations in non-epithelial ovarian tumors,"Background: Germline truncating mutations in DICER1, an RNase III-type endoribonuclease essential for processing of microRNAs, are seen in families with the pleuropulmonary blastoma-family tumor and dysplasia syndrome; these individuals have a propensity to develop non-epithelial ovarian tumors (i.e. sex-cord stromal and germ cell tumors). Methods:  We sequenced the whole transcriptomes or exomes of 14 non-epithelial ovarian tumors and noted closely clustered mutations in the RNase IIIb domain of DICER1 in four cases.  Using Sanger sequencing, we then analyzed additional ovarian tumors for mutations in this region.  The impact of the mutations on the enzymatic activity of Dicer1 was determined using in vitro RNA cleavage assays. Results:  RNase IIIb domain DICER1 mutations were found in 30/102 non-epithelial ovarian tumors (29%), predominantly Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors (26/43, 60%), including 4/4 from individuals with germline DICER1 mutations.  The mutations were restricted to metal binding sites within the RNase IIIb catalytic centres critical for miRNA interaction and cleavage, and were somatic in all 14 cases where germline DNA was available for testing. Of 266 epithelial ovarian and endometrial cancers tested, one case, an ovarian carcinosarcoma, had a hotspot mutation.  In vitro, the mutant DICER proteins showed reduced RNase IIIb activity but retained RNase IIIa activity. Conclusions:  Somatic missense mutations of the RNase IIIb domain of DICER1 are common in non-epithelial ovarian tumors.  Genetic, pathologic, and functional evidence suggest that these mutations do not obliterate DICER1 function, rather, they alter it in specific cell types, a novel mechanism through which perturbed microRNA expression is oncogenic.",EGAD00001000058,Exome Sequencing analysis,Exome Sequencing analysis, Illumina Genome Analyzer II

EGAS00001000136,"""Targeted High Throughput Sequencing in Clinical Cancer Settings: Formaldehyde fixed-paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor tissues, input amount and tumor heterogeneity""","""Background: Massively parallel sequencing technologies have brought an enormous increase in sequencing throughput. However, these technologies need to be further improved with regard to reproducibility and applicability to clinical samples and settings. 
Methods: Using identification of genetic variations in prostate cancer as an example we address three crucial challenges in the field of targeted re-sequencing: Small nucleotide variation (SNV) detection in samples of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue material, minimal amount of input sample and sampling in view of tissue heterogeneity.
Results: We show that FFPE tissue material can supplement for fresh frozen tissues for the detection of SNVs and that solution-based enrichment experiments can be accomplished with small amounts of DNA with only minimal effects on enrichment uniformity and data variance. 
Finally, we address the question whether the heterogeneity of a tumor is reflected by different genetic alterations, e.g. different foci of a tumor display different genomic patterns. We show that the tumor heterogeneity plays an important role for the detection of copy number variations, but is of minor importance for the detection of somatic variations.
Conclusions: The application of high throughput sequencing technologies in cancer genomics opens up a new dimension for the identification of disease mechanisms. In particular the ability to use small amounts of FFPE samples available from surgical tumor resections and histopathological examinations facilitates the collection of precious tissue materials. However, care needs to be taken in regard to the locations of the biopsies taken, which can have an influence on the prediction of copy number variations. Bearing these technological challenges in mind will significantly improve many large-scale sequencing studies and will - on a long-range - result in a more reliable prediction of individual cancer therapies.""",EGAD00001000034,"""Usage of small amounts of DNA for Illumina sequencing""","""Usage of small amounts of DNA for Illumina sequencing""", Illumina Genome Analyzer II

The mutation rates varied widely among tumors. The diversity of mutation rates was significantly correlated with the distinct MLH1 copy-number status. Exome-Seq revealed intensive genomic instability in a tumor with MLH1 homozygous deletion, indicated by a dramatically elevated mutation rate of somatic substitutions, small insertions/deletions (indels), as well as indels presented at microsatellites. Notably, we detected MLH1 allelic loss in 4 tumors. MLH1 expression was decreased by nearly half in these cases. While they were negative in the conventional microsatellite instability assay, they showed a 10.5-fold increase in the mutation rate of somatic indels, e.g. truncating indels in TP53 and TGFBR2, indicating MLH1 haploinsufficiency in correction of DNA indel errors. We further analyzed the exomes of 15 renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) and confirmed MLH1 haploinsufficiency. We observed a significant increase in the mutation rate of somatic indels in affected cases and identified recurrent truncating indels in several cancer genes such as VHL, PBRM1 and JARID1C.

Using whole-genome twin data to discriminate between correctly identified single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and errors a strategy for the accurate detection of SNVs was developed. By applying stringent sequencing quality measures, excluding error-prone regions and selecting SNVs identified by different mapping and variation calling algorithms, error rates were ~37-fold reduced. This enabled us to identify the first discordant SNVs in monozygotic twins using whole-genome sequencing. In addition, by showing that novel SNVs are highly enriched in errors, accurate estimates of the number of novel and rare SNVs occurring in unrelated Caucasian individuals were obtained.

We used exome and low-coverage whole-genome sequencing to characterize the critical secondary events associated with leukemic transformation. RAG-mediated deletions emerge as the dominant mutational process, accounting for at least 43% of genomic rearrangements and characterized by the presence of recombination signal sequence motifs near the breakpoints; incorporation of non-templated sequence at the junction and a ten-fold enrichment at promoters and enhancers of genes actively transcribed in early B-lineage development. Single-cell tracking shows that this mechanism is not restricted to one founder cell but is rather active throughout leukemic evolution.

We used exome and low-coverage whole-genome sequencing to characterize the critical secondary events associated with leukemic transformation. RAG-mediated deletions emerge as the dominant mutational process, accounting for at least 43% of genomic rearrangements and characterized by the presence of recombination signal sequence motifs near the breakpoints; incorporation of non-templated sequence at the junction and a ten-fold enrichment at promoters and enhancers of genes actively transcribed in early B-lineage development. Single-cell tracking shows that this mechanism is not restricted to one founder cell but is rather active throughout leukemic evolution.

These processes operate over levels ranging from individual exons to whole chromosomes, often generating correlated copy number alterations across hundreds of linked genes. An example of the latter is the 2% of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) characterized by recurrent intrachromosomal amplification of megabase regions of chromosome 21 (iAMP21)7,8  To dissect the interplay between mutational processes and selection on this scale, we used genomic, cytogenetic and transcriptional analysis, coupled with novel bioinformatic approaches, to reconstruct the evolution of iAMP21 ALL. We find that individuals born with the rare constitutional Robertsonian translocation between chromosomes 15 and 21, rob(15;21)(q10;q10)c, have ~2700-fold increased risk of developing iAMP21 ALL compared to the general population. In such cases, amplification is initiated by chromothripsis involving both sister chromatids of the dicentric Robertsonian chromosome. In contrast, sporadic iAMP21 is typically initiated by breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) events, often followed by chromothripsis or other rearrangements. In both sporadic and iAMP21 in rob(15;21)c individuals, the final stages of amplification frequently involve large-scale duplications of the abnormal chromosome. The end-product is a derivative chromosome 21 or a derivative originating from the rob(15;21)c chromosome, der(15;21), respectively, with gene dosage optimised for leukemic potential, showing constrained copy number levels over multiple linked genes. In summary, the constitutional translocation, rob(15;21)c, predisposes to leukemia through a novel mechanism, namely a propensity to undergo chromothripsis, likely related to its dicentric nature. More generally, our data illustrate that several cancer-specific mutational processes, applied sequentially, can co-ordinate to fashion copy number profiles over large genomic scales, incrementally refining the fitness benefits of aggregated gene dosage changes.", Illumina HiSeq 2000;

High-resolution copy number analysis of 125 tumors of which 24 were subjected to whole-exome sequencing identified 135 homozygous deletions and 994 somatic gene mutations with predicted functional consequences. We identified new recurrent alterations in 4 genes (ARID1A, RPS6KA3, NFE2L2 and IRF2) not previously described in HCC. Functional analyses demonstrated tumor suppressor properties for IRF2 whose inactivation, exclusively found in hepatitis B virus related tumors, leads to impaired TP53 function. Alternatively, inactivation of proteins involved in chromatin remodeling was frequent and predominant in alcohol related tumors. Moreover, activation of the oxidative stress metabolism and inactivation of RPS6KA3 were new pathways associated with WNT/beta-catenin activation, thereby suggesting a cooperative effect in tumorigenesis. This study shows the dramatic somatic genetic diversity in HCC, it reveals interactions between oncogene and tumor suppressor gene mutations markedly related to specific risk factors.

However, DNA copy number and gene expression signatures indicate differences between adult and paediatric cases. To explore the genetic events underlying this distinction, we sequenced the exomes of 48 paediatric GBM samples. Somatic mutations in the H3.3-ATRX-DAXX chromatin remodelling pathway were identified in 44% of tumours (21/48). Recurrent mutations in H3F3A, which encodes the replication-independent histone 3 variant H3.3, were observed in 31% of tumours, and led to amino acid substitutions at two critical positions within the histone tail (K27M, G34R/G34V) involved in key regulatory post-translational modifications. Mutations in ATRX (alpha-thalassaemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked) and DAXX (death-domain associated protein), encoding two subunits of a chromatin remodelling complex required for H3.3 incorporation at pericentric heterochromatin and telomeres, were identified in 31% of samples overall, and in 100% of tumours harbouring a G34R or G34V H3.3 mutation. Somatic TP53 mutations were identified in 54% of all cases, and in 86% of samples with H3F3A and/or ATRX mutations. Screening of a large cohort of gliomas of various grades and histologies (n=784) showed H3F3A mutations to be specific to GBM and highly prevalent in children and young adults. Furthermore, the presence of H3F3A/ATRX-DAXX/TP53 mutations was strongly associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres and specific gene expression profiles. This is, to our knowledge, the first report to highlight recurrent mutations in a regulatory histone in humans, and our data suggest that defects of the chromatin architecture underlie paediatric and young adult GBM pathogenesis.",EGAD00001000134,"Sequence reads for pediatric GBM samples for manuscript: Driver mutations in histone H3.3 and chromatin

EGAS00001000268,Accurate mutation detection in leukemia by re-sequencing a cancer gene set,"With the advent of whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing, high-quality catalogs of recurrently mutated cancer genes are becoming available for many cancer types. Increasing access to sequencing technology, including bench-top sequencers, provide the opportunity to re-sequence a limited set of cancer genes across a patient cohort with limited processing time. Here, we re-sequenced a set of cancer genes in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) using the Roche/454 technology coupled with Nimblegen sequence capture. First, we investigated how a maximal sensitivity and specificity of mutation detection can be achieved through a benchmark study. We tested nine combinations of different mapping and variant-calling methods, varied the variant calling parameters, and compared the predicted mutations with a large independent validation set obtained by capillary re-sequencing. We found that the combination of two mapping algorithms, namely BWA-SW and SSAHA2, coupled with the variant calling algorithm Atlas-SNP2 yields the highest sensitivity (95%) and the highest specificity (93%). Next, we applied this analysis pipeline to identify mutations in a set of 58 cancer genes, in a panel of 18 T-ALL cell lines and 15 T-ALL patient samples. We confirmed mutations in known T-ALL drivers, including PHF6, NF1, FBXW7, NOTCH1, KRAS, NRAS, PIK3CA, and PTEN. Interestingly, we also found mutations in several cancer genes that had not been linked to T-ALL before, including JAK3. Finally, we re-sequenced a small set of 39 candidate genes and identified recurrent mutations in TET1, SPRY3 and SPRY4. In conclusion, we established an optimized analysis pipeline for Roche/454 data that can be applied to accurately detect gene mutations in cancer, which led to the identification of several new candidate T-ALL driver mutations.",EGAD00001000150,Targeted re-sequencing of 97 genes in T-ALL,Targeted re-sequencing of 97 genes in T-ALL, 454 GS FLX Titanium
EGAS00001000269,Identification of the underlying causal variant in a multi generational family with autosomal dominant common variable immunodeficiency,"Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the most common form of primary immunodeficiency with an estimated incidence of 1:10,000. It has been apparent for many years that CVID has a genetic component, occurs frequently in families and can have both a recessive or dominant mode of inheritance. In recent years, 4 genes underlying CVID have been identified; however, mutations within in them are estimated to account for no more than 10% of all cases of CVID.
We have identified a multi-generational family with autosomal dominant CVID. Genome-wide linkage analysis has mapped the locus underlying CVID in this family to an approximately 9.2 Mb interval on chromosome 3q27.3-q29, between the markers D3S3570 and D3S1265. This locus is distinct from any of the previously mapped susceptibility loci suggesting a novel genetic variant is responsible for disease in this family.

EGAS00001000292,Molecular characterization of invasive lobular carcinoma,"Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is the second most common histological subtype of breast cancer accounting for 10-15% of cases. ILC differs from invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)with respect to epidemiology, histology, and clinical presentation. Moreover, ILC is less
sensitive to chemotherapy, more frequently bilateral, and more prone to form gastrointestinal, peritoneal, and ovarian metastases than IDCs. In contrast to IDC, the prognostic value of
histological grade (HG) in ILC is controversial. One of the three major components of histological grading (tubule formation) is missing in ILC which hinders the process of grading
in this histological subtype and results in the classification of approximately two thirds of ILC as HG 2.
Over the last decade, a number of gene expression signatures have shed light onto breast cancer classification, allowing breast cancer care to become more personalized. With
respect to the management of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, several gene expression signatures provide prognostic and/or predictive information beyond what is possible with current classical clinico-pathological parameters alone. Nevertheless, most studies using gene expression signature have not considered different histologic subtypes
separately. Recently, a comprehensive research program has elucidated some of the biological underpinnings of invasive lobular carcinoma. Genetic material extracted from 200 ILC tumor samples were studied using gene expression profiling and identified ILC
molecular subtypes. These proliferation-driven gene signatures of ILC appear to have prognostic significance. In particular, the Genomic Grade (GG) gene signature improved upon HG in ILC and added prognostic value to classic clinico-pathologic factors. In addition this study demonstrated that most ILC are molecularly characterized as luminal-A (~75%)followed by luminal-B (~20%) and HER2-positve tumors (~5%). Moreover, we investigated the prognostic value of known gene signatures/ gene modules in the same cohort of ILC.

However, Exome sequencing of 3 affected and 1 unaffected family members has not identified the causative variant suggesting the possibility of an intronic or intergenic variant in this region or elsewhere in the genome. We propose to conduct whole genome sequencing of 5 members of the pedigree at a depth of 20X. The chosen samples are two sets of parents plus one member of an unaffected branch of the pedigree who shares the risk haplotype on chromosome 19. Sequencing of the two sets of parents will be used along with the genome-wide SNP data to impute 4 affected children giving an effect sample size of 6 affected individuals.", Illumina HiSeq 2000;

EGAS00001000318,Whole-exome Sequencing Combined with Functional Genomics Reveals Novel Candidate Driver Cancer Genes in Endometrial Cancer,"Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological malignancy, with more than 280,000 cases occurring annually worldwide. Although previous studies have identified important common somatic mutations in endometrial cancer, they have primarily focused on a small set of known cancer genes and have thus provided a limited view of the molecular basis underlying this disease. Here we developed an integrated systems biology approach to identifying novel cancer genes contributing to endometrial tumorigenesis. We first performed whole-exome sequencing on 13 endometrial cancers and matched normal samples, systematically identifying somatic alterations with high precision and sensitivity. We then combined bioinformatics prioritization with high-throughput screening (including both shRNA-mediated knockdown and expression of wild type and mutant constructs) in a highly sensitive cell viability assay. Our results revealed 12 potential driver cancer genes including 10 tumor suppressor candidates (ARID1A, INHBA, KMO, TTLL5, GRM8, IGFBP3, AKTIP, PHKA2, TRPS1 and WNT11) and two oncogene candidates (ERBB3 and RPS6KC1). The results in the â€œsensorâ€ cell line were recapitulated by siRNA-mediated knockdown in endometrial cancer cell lines. Focusing on ARID1A, we integrated mutation profiles with functional proteomics in 222 endometrial cancer samples, demonstrating that ARID1A mutations frequently co-occur with mutations in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway and are associated with PI3K pathway activation. siRNA knockdown in endometrial cancer cell lines increased AKT phosphorylation supporting ARID1A as a novel regulator of PI3K pathway activity. Our study presents the first unbiased view of somatic coding mutations in endometrial cancer and provides functional evidence for diverse driver genes and mutations in this disease.",EGAD00001000201,MDACC-endo,MDACC-endo, AB SOLiD System 3.0;

We assessed the SAIF genome for SNPs with health and disease consequences and found that the individual was at a higher risk for multiple sclerosis and a few other diseases.   In assessing SNPs that modulate drug response we found a variation that predicts a favorable response to metformin used for treating diabetes.

Both alleles of RB1 were inactivated in the tumor samples. 3 of the patients had sporadic retinoblastoma and one patient had inherited retinoblastoma. Overall, there were few single nucleotide changes in coding regions of the genome and some of the tumors had few chromosomal lesions. There were very few new genetic lesions in the xenograft compared to the primary tumor.

Patients with the AML M2 subtype harbor a translocation between chromosomes 8 and 21 [t(8;21)] that yields the chimeric fusion gene RUNX1(AML1)-RUNX1T1(ETO), while patients with AML M4Eo express the chimeric fusion gene CBFÎ²-SMMHC(MYH11) as a result of an inversion/translocation event of chromosome 16 [inv(16)/t(16;16)].

By measuring the genomewide aggregated allelic loss and point mutations, we determined the fractional tumor-derived DNA concentrations in plasma and correlated these values with tumor size and surgical treatment. We have also demonstrated the application of this approach to monitoring a complex oncologic scenario, in a patient with two synchronous cancers. In particular, through the use of multi-regional sequencing of tumoral tissues and shotgun sequencing of plasma DNA, we have shown that plasma DNA sequencing is a valuable approach for studying tumoral heterogeneity. Shotgun plasma DNA sequencing is thus a powerful tool for cancer monitoring and research.",EGAD00001000308,"Cancer Genome Scanning in Plasma: Detection of Tumor-Associated Copy Number Aberrations, Single-Nucleotide Variants, and Tumoral Heterogeneity by Massively Parallel Sequencing","Cancer Genome Scanning in Plasma: Detection of Tumor-Associated Copy Number Aberrations, Single-Nucleotide Variants, and Tumoral Heterogeneity by Massively Parallel Sequencing",

Our analysis identified a cryptic chromosome 16 inversion [inv(16)(p13.3q24.3)] in 27% of pediatric cases, which encodes a CBFA2T3-GLIS2 fusion protein. Expression of CBFA2T3-GLIS2 in Drosophila and murine hematopoietic cells induced bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling, and resulted in a marked increase in the self-renewal capacity of hematopoietic progenitors.

Here, using complementary genome-wide profiling approaches, we show that hypodiploid ALL comprises two subtypes that differ in the severity of aneuploidy, transcriptional profile and submicroscopic genetic alterations. Near haploid cases with 24-31 chromosomes frequently harbor alterations targeting receptor tyrosine kinase- and Ras signaling (71%) and IKZF3 (AIOLOS; 13%). In contrast, low hypodiploid ALL cases with 32-39 chromosomes are characterized by TP53 alterations, almost half of which are present in non-tumor cells, and have alterations of IKZF2 (HELIOS; 53%) and RB1 (41%). Both near haploid and low hypodiploid tumors exhibit activation of Ras and PI3K signaling pathways, and are sensitive to PI3K inhibition, indicating that these drugs should be explored as a new therapeutic strategy for this frequently lethal form of leukemia.",EGAD00001000260,DATA FILES FOR SJHYPO,DATA FILES FOR SJHYPO,

It is now feasible, in a clinically relevant time-frame, for a clinically manageable cost, to screen DNA from patient tumours for mutations essentially genome-wide. The challenge for personalised medicine will be to increase the sample size to thousands or tens of thousands of well-characterised cases in order to attain sufficient statistical power to stratify patients accurately across the complexity and genomic heterogeneity expected for most of the common tumour types. Currently, whole genome sequencing on this scale is not feasible, and targeted sequencing of relevant portions of the genome will be required. Pilot data We have developed protocols for large-scale, multiplexed sequencing of 100-200 genes in thousands of samples. Essentially, using robotic technology, genomic DNA from the cancer specimen is processed into sequencing libraries with unique DNA barcodes, thereby allowing sequencing reads to be attributed to the sample they derive from. Currently, these sequencing libraries can be generated in a 96-well format using fully automated protocols, and we are exploring methods to expand this to a 384-well format. The sequencing libraries are pooled and hybridized to custom sets of RNA baits representing the genomic regions of interest. Sequencing of the pulled-down libraries is done in pools of 48-96 samples per lane of an Illumina Hi-Seq. This protocol is already implemented at the Sanger Institute. We have published proof that somatic mutations in novel cancer genes can be identified from exome-wide sequencing. In unpublished pilot data, we have established the feasibility of robotic library production, custom pull-down, and multiplexed sequencing of barcoded libraries for 100 known myeloid cancer genes across 760 myelodysplasia samples. Highlights of the data thus far analysed reveal that the coverage is remarkably even between samples; when 96 samples are run, average coverage per lane of sequencing is ~250, with 90-95% of targeted exons covered by >25 reads; known mutations can be discovered in the data set; and the protocol is amenable to whole genome amplified DNA. The bioinformatic algorithms for identification of substitutions and indels in pull-down data are well-established; we have pilot data proving that copy number changes, LOH and genomic rearrangements in specific regions of interest can also be identified by tiling of baits across the relevant loci. Proposal We propose to apply this methodology to 10000 samples from patients with AML enrolled in clinical trials over the last 10-20 years. Oncogenic point mutations and potentially genomic rearrangements will be identified, and linked to clinical outcome data, with a view to undertaking the following sorts of analyses: â€¢ Identification of co-occurrence, mutual exclusivity and clusters of driver mutations. â€¢ Correlation of prognosis with driver mutations and potentially gene-gene interactions â€¢ Exploration of genomic markers of drug response Ultimately, we would like to be in a position to release the mutation data together with matched clinical outcome data to genuine medical researchers via a controlled access approach, possibly within the COSMIC framework (www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/). The vision here is to generate a portal whereby a clinician faced with an AML patient and his / her mutational profile can obtain a â€˜personalisedâ€™ prediction of outcome, together with a fair assessment of the uncertainty of the estimate.

Identification of co-occurrence, mutual exclusivity and clusters of driver mutations. ? Correlation of prognosis with driver mutations and potentially gene-gene interactions ? Exploration of genomic markers of drug response Ultimately, we would like to be in a position to release the mutation data together with matched clinical outcome data to genuine medical researchers via a controlled access approach, possibly within the COSMIC framework (www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/). The vision here is to generate a portal whereby a clinician faced with an AML patient and his / her mutational profile can obtain a ?personalised? prediction of outcome, together with a fair assessment of the uncertainty of the estimate. With a sufficient sample size, there would also be the potential to develop decision support algorithms for therapeutic choices based on such data.", Illumina MiSeq;

Massively parallel sequencing of  maternal plasma DNA has been used to detect fetal trisomies 21, 18, 13 and selected sex  chromosomal aneuploidies noninvasively. Case reports describing the detection of fetal  microdeletions from maternal plasma using massively parallel sequencing have been reported.  However, these previous reports were either polymorphism-dependent or used statistical  analyses which were confined to one or a small number of selected parts of the genome. In  this report, we reported a procedure for performing noninvasive prenatal karyotyping at 3 Mb  resolution across the whole genome through the massively parallel sequencing of maternal  plasma DNA. This method has been used to analyze the plasma obtained from 6 cases. In 5  cases, fetal microduplications or microdeletions have been detected successfully from maternal  plasma. The two cases with fetal microduplications represented the first noninvasive prenatal  detection of such changes from maternal plasma. In the remaining case, the plasma DNA  sequencing result was consistent with the pregnant mother being a carrier of a microduplication.  Simulation analyses were performed for determining the number of plasma DNA molecules that  would need to be sequenced and aligned for enhancing the diagnostic resolution of noninvasive  prenatal karyotyping to 2 Mb and 1 Mb.

We circumvent these by deep RNA sequencing of purified beta cells from 11 individuals, presenting here the first characterization of the human beta cell transcriptome. Additionally, we perform the first comparison of gene expression profiles between beta cells, whole islets (N=7) and beta cell depleted islet preparations (N=5), revealing thus beta cell specific expression signatures.

Functional analysis of the PAX5 germline variants demonstrated reduced transcriptional activity, as well as decreased interaction with Groucho-4.

EGAS00001000476,Negligible impact on missing heritability of autoimmune-locus rare coding-region variants,"Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified common variants of modest effect size at hundreds of loci for common autoimmune diseases - however a substantial fraction of heritability remains unexplained, and to which rare variants may contribute.  To discover rare variants and test them for association with a phenotype, the majority of studies re-sequence a small initial sample size and then genotype the discovered variants in a larger sample set. This approach will fail to analyse a large fraction of the rare variants present in the entire sample set. Here we perform simultaneous amplicon sequencing-based variant discovery and genotyping for coding exons of 25 GWAS risk genes in 41,911 white-European origin UK subjects comprising 24,892 subjects with six autoimmune disease phenotypes and 17,019 controls, and show that rare coding-region variants at known loci play a negligible role in common autoimmune disease susceptibility. These results do not support the rare variant - synthetic genome-wide association hypothesis. Many known autoimmune disease risk loci contain multiple independent common and low frequency variant association signals, and so genes in these loci are a priori stronger candidates to harbor rare coding-region variants than other genes. Our data suggest that the missing heritability for common autoimmune diseases may not lie in the rare coding-region variant portion of the allelic spectrum, but perhaps as others have proposed in very many common variant signals of weak effect.",EGAD00001000623,"VCF file, post sample QC","This VCF contains the full sequence data post QC.

EGAS00001000484,Whole genome and transcriptome analysis of a sporadic and recurring parathyroid carcinoma,"Parathyroid carcinoma is an extremely rare endocrine malignancy with an estimated incidence of less than 1 per million population. Excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone, extremely high serum calcium level and the deleterious effects of hypercalcemia are the clinical manifestations of the disease. Up to 60% of patients develop multiple disease recurrences and although long-term survival is possible with palliative surgery, permanent remission is rarely achieved. Molecular drivers of sporadic parathyroid carcinoma have remained largely unknown. Previous studies, mostly based on familial cases of the disease, suggested a potential role for the tumor suppressor MEN1 and proto-oncogene RET in benign parathyroid tumorigenesis while the tumor suppressor HRPT2 and proto-oncogene CCND1 may also act as drivers in parathyroid cancer. Here, we report the complete genomic analysis of a sporadic and recurring parathyroid carcinoma. Mutational landscapes of the primary and recurrent tumor specimens were analyzed using high throughput sequencing technologies. Such molecular profiling allowed for identification of somatic mutations never previously identified in this malignancy. These included single nucleotide point mutations in well characterized cancer genes such as mTOR, MLL2, CDKN2C and PIK3CA. Comparison of acquired mutations in patient-matched primary and recurrent tumors revealed loss of PIK3CA activating mutation during the evolution of the tumor from the primary to the recurrence. Structural variations leading to gene fusions and regions of copy loss and gain were identified at a single-base resolution. Loss of short arm of chromosome 1 along with somatic mis-sense and truncating mutations in CDKN2C and THRAP3, respectively, provide new evidence for the potential role of these genes as tumor suppressors in parathyroid cancer.

The tree was calibrated with archaeological data from the initial expansion of the Sardinian population ~7,700 years ago. The ages of nodes highlight different genetic strata in Sardinia and reveal presumptive timing of  coalescence with other human populations. We calculate a putative age for coalescence of ~180-200,000 years ago, consistent with previous mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) based estimates.",EGAD00001000618,Sardinian Chromsome Y 2012 Analysis,1204 Sardinian males,

EGAS00001000552,Reference epigenomes generated as part of the International Human Epigenomics Consortium (IHEC),"The term epigenome refers to chemical modifications of DNA and proteins that control genome (a term referring to all the DNA within our cells) structure and activity. In contrast to the genome, which remains mostly the same throughout an individuals life, the epigenome changes during development and aging, in response to various external stimuli and as diseases emerge. Epigenome changes can result in profound changes in which genes are turned on and hence how cells behave. Thus, an understanding of what epigenome states exist in different cell types and how these states are specified are critically important to many aspects of human health and disease. We propose to build on our internationally leading experience in epigenome mapping to establish a major Canadian centre of epigenome analysis that will demonstrate an ability to deliver complete reference epigenome information on a full spectrum of normal and diseased human cell types; to improve the technology for broader applications in the future; and to make this technology rapidly available to Canadian scientists. To accomplish this goal we have developed an integrated program with internationally recognized biologists and clinicians with specialized access to, and knowledge of, the normal and diseased cell types we will analyze. This collaborative team effort will transform our understanding of the relationship between epigenome modifications and how genes are turned on or turned off, and lay the foundation for larger studies to revolutionize our understanding of how diseases develop and how to anticipate and treat them more effectively.",EGAD00001000629,ChIP-seq assays for CEMT_9 (IX1242),ChIP-seq assays for CEMT_9 (IX1242).,

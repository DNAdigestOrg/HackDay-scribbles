Massive Genomic Rearrangment Acquired in a Single Catastrophic Event During Cancer Development,"Cancer is driven by mutation. Using Agilent exome hybridisation capture and Illumina GA massively parallel sequencing technology, we aim to sequence ~1600 microRNAs plus the protein coding genome of 25 matched human renal cancer samples. Bespoke algorithms are being developed to identify the somatically acquired point mutations, insertions and deletions in these samples. This project will give unprecedented insights into mutational processes, cellular repair pathways and gene networks associated with renal cancer development.Agilent whole exome hybridisation capture will be performed on genomic DNA derived from 25 renal cancers and matched normal DNA from the same patients. Three lanes of Illumina GA sequencing will be performed on the resulting 50 exome libraries and mapped to build 37 of the human reference genome to facilitate the identification of novel cancer genes.

Geographical structure and differential natural selection among North European populations,"European populations and epidemiological cohorts are of special significance in the current era of genomic research aiming to characterize the background of common human diseases. The genome sequence, detailed information of genetic variations between individuals, high-throughput molecular technologies and novel statistical strategies create new possibilities to define genetic and life-style risk factors behind common health problems. Studies of large population cohorts are needed to transform the genetic information to detailed understanding of the predisposing factors in diseases affecting most human populations. European twin cohorts provide a unique competitive advantage for investigations of the role of genetics and environment or life style in the etiology of common diseases. This project will apply and develop new molecular and statistical strategies to analyze unique European twin and other population cohorts to define and characterise the genetic, environmental and life-style components in the background of health problems like obesity, migraine, coronary heart disease and stroke, representing major health care problems worldwide.

Carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity reactions in Europeans,"An antiepileptic drug carbamazepine is well tolerated by the majority of patients, but can cause severe and potentialy fatal hypersensitivity reactions in a small number of individuals. The aim of this study was to identify genetic predictors of hypersensitivity reactions to carbamazepine. We undertook a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 22 patients of European ancestry with carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS) and compared our data with genotypes from a healthy population within the WTCCC. We performed imputation of classical HLA alleles according to  a recently described method (Science. 2010 Dec 10;330(6010):1551-7. Epub 2010 Nov 4). GWAS statistical analysis was performed using logistic regression with an additive model of inheritance.

A small cell lung cancer genome reports complex tobacco exposure signatures,"Cancer is driven by mutation. Worldwide, tobacco smoking is the major lifestyle exposure that causes cancer, exerting carcinogenicity through 60 chemicals that bind and mutate DNA. Using massively parallel sequencing technology, we sequenced a small cell lung cancer cell line, NCI-H209, to explore the mutational burden associated with tobacco smoking. 22,910 somatic substitutions were identified, including 132 in coding exons. Multiple mutation signatures testify to the cocktail of carcinogens in tobacco smoke and their proclivities for particular bases and surrounding sequence context. Effects of transcription-coupled repair and a second, more general expression-linked repair pathway were evident. We identified a tandem duplication that duplicates exons 3-8 of CHD7 in-frame, and another two lines carrying PVT1-CHD7 fusion genes, suggesting that CHD7 may be recurrently rearranged in this disease. These findings illustrate the potential for next-generation sequencing to provide unprecedented insights into mutational processes, cellular repair pathways and gene networks associated with cancer.

A Comprehensive Catalogue of Somatic Mutations from a Human Cancer Genome,"We have carried out complete sequencing of the genome of the human male maligant melanoma cell line COLO-829 using the Illumina Genome Analyzer II. We generated a sequencing library with a median insert size of ~200 bp following random fragmentation and gel fractionation of the genomic DNA. We sequenced 75 bases from both ends of these templates to cover the COLO-829 genome to an average depth of more than 40x. We have carried out purity-filtering (PF) to remove mixed reads, where two or more different template molecules are close enough on the surface of the flow-cell to form a mixed or overlapping cluster. No other filtering of the data has been carried out prior to submission. We have also submitted sequence data for a lymphoblastoid control cell line COLO-829BL from the same individual.

Procardis study on novel susceptibility genes for coronary artery disease (CAD),"An increased level of Lp(a) lipoprotein has been identified as a risk factor for coronary artery disease that is highly heritable. The genetic determinants of the Lp(a) lipoprotein level and their relevance for the risk of coronary disease are incompletely understood. METHODS: We used a novel gene chip containing 48,742 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 2100 candidate genes to test for associations in 3145 case subjects with coronary disease and 3352 control subjects. Replication was tested in three independent populations involving 4846 additional case subjects with coronary disease and 4594 control subjects. RESULTS: Three chromosomal regions (6q26-27, 9p21, and 1p13) were strongly associated with the risk of coronary disease. The LPA locus on 6q26-27 encoding Lp(a) lipoprotein had the strongest association. We identified a common variant (rs10455872) at the LPA locus with an odds ratio for coronary disease of 1.70 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.49 to 1.95) and another independent variant (rs3798220) with an odds ratio of 1.92 (95% CI, 1.48 to 2.49). Both variants were strongly associated with an increased level of Lp(a) lipoprotein, a reduced copy number in LPA (which determines the number of kringle IV-type 2 repeats), and a small Lp(a) lipoprotein size. Replication studies confirmed the effects of both variants on the Lp(a) lipoprotein level and the risk of coronary disease. A meta-analysis showed that with a genotype score involving both LPA SNPs, the odds ratios for coronary disease were 1.51 (95% CI, 1.38 to 1.66) for one variant and 2.57 (95% CI, 1.80 to 3.67) for two or more variants. After adjustment for the Lp(a) lipoprotein level, the association between the LPA genotype score and the risk of coronary disease was abolished. CONCLUSIONS: We identified two LPA variants that were strongly associated with both an increased level of Lp(a) lipoprotein and an increased risk of coronary disease. Our findings provide support for a causal role of Lp(a) lipoprotein in coronary disease.

Identification of cis- and trans-regulatory variation modulating microRNA expression levels in human fibroblasts,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are regulatory noncoding RNAs that affect the production of a significant fraction of human mRNAs via post-transcriptional regulation. Interindividual variation of the miRNA expression levels is likely to influence the expression of miRNA target genes and may therefore contribute to phenotypic differences in humans, including susceptibility to common disorders. The extent to which miRNA levels are genetically controlled is largely unknown. In this report, we assayed the expression levels of miRNAs in primary fibroblasts from 180 European newborns of the GenCord project and performed association analysis to identify eQTLs (expression quantitative traits loci). We detected robust expression for 121 miRNAs out of 365 interrogated. We have identified significant cis- (10%) and trans- (11%) eQTLs. Furthermore, we detected one genomic locus (rs1522653) that influences the expression levels of five miRNAs, thus unraveling a novel mechanism for coregulation of miRNA expression"

The patterns and dynamics of genomic instability in metastatic pancreatic cancer,"Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive malignancy with a five-year mortality of 97â€“98%, usually due to widespread metastatic disease. Previous studies indicate that this disease has a complex genomic landscape, with frequent copy number changes and point mutations, but genomic rearrangements have not been characterized in detail. Despite the clinical importance of metastasis, there remain fundamental questions about the clonal structures of metastatic tumours, including phylogenetic relationships among metastases, the scale of ongoing parallel evolution in metastatic and primary sites, and how the tumour disseminates. Here we harness advances in DNA sequencing to annotate genomic rearrangements in 13 patients with pancreatic cancer and explore clonal relationships among metastases. We find that pancreatic cancer acquires rearrangements indicative of telomere dysfunction and abnormal cell-cycle control, namely dysregulated G1-to-S-phase transition with intact G2â€“M checkpoint. These initiate amplification of cancer genes and occur predominantly in early cancer development rather than the later stages of the disease. Genomic instability frequently persists after cancer dissemination, resulting in ongoing, parallel and even convergent evolution among different metastases. We find evidence that there is genetic heterogeneity among metastasis-initiating cells, that seeding metastasis may require driver mutations beyond those required for primary tumours, and that phylogenetic trees across metastases show organ-specific branches. These data attest to the richness of genetic variation in cancer, brought about by the tandem forces of genomic instability and evolutionary selection."
Evolution of an adenomacarcinoma in response to selection by targeted kinase inhibitors,"Background - Adenocarcinomas of the tongue are rare and represent the minority (20-25%) of salivary gland tumors affecting the tongue.  We investigated the utility of massively parallel sequencing to characterize an adenocarcinoma of the tongue, before and after treatment. 
                        Results - In the pre-treatment tumor we identified 7,629 genes within regions of copy number gain. 1,078 genes exhibited increased expression relative to the blood and unrelated tumors and four genes contained somatic protein-coding mutations. Our analysis suggested the tumor cells were driven by the RET oncogene. Genes whose protein products are targeted by the RET inhibitors sunitinib and sorafenib correlated with being amplified and or highly expressed. Consistent with our observations administration of sunitinib was associated with stable disease lasting 4 months, after which the lung lesions began to grow.  Administration of sorafenib and sulindac provided disease stabilization for an additional 3 months after which the cancer progressed and new lesions appeared. A recurring metastasis possessed 7,288 genes within copy number amplicons, 385 genes exhibiting increased expression relative to other tumours and 9 new somatic protein coding mutations. The observed mutations and amplif
                        ications were  consistent with therapeutic resistance arising through activation of the MAPK and AKT pathways. Conclusions - We conclude that complete genomic characterization of a rare tumour has the potential to aid in clinical decision making and identifying therapeutic approaches where no established treatment protocols exist.  These results also provide direct in-vivo genomic evidence for mutational evolution within a tumor under drug selection and potential mechanisms of drug resistance accrual.

ZNF703 is a common Luminal B breast cancer oncogene that differentially regulates luminal and basal progenitors in human mammary epithelium.,"The telomeric amplicon at 8p12 is common in oestrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancers. Array-CGH and expression analyses of 1172 primary breast tumours revealed that ZNF703 was the single gene within the minimal amplicon and was amplified predominantly in the Luminal B subtype. Amplification was shown to correlate with increased gene and protein expression and was associated with a distinct expression signature and poor clinical outcome. ZNF703 transformed NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, behaving as a classical oncogene, and regulated proliferation in human luminal breast cancer cell lines and immortalized human mammary epithelial cells. Manipulation of ZNF703 expression in the luminal MCF7 cell line modified the effects of TGFÎ² on proliferation. Overexpression of ZNF703 in normal human breast epithelial cells enhanced the frequency of in vitro colony-forming cells from luminal progenitors. Taken together, these data strongly point to ZNF703 as a novel oncogene in Luminal B breast cancer."

METABRIC,"The elucidation of breast cancer subgroups and their molecular drivers
requires integrated views of the genome and transcriptome from
representative numbers of patients. We present an integrated analysis of
copy number and gene expression in a discovery and validation
set of 997 and 995 primary breast tumours, respectively, with long-term
clinical follow-up. Inherited variants (CNVs, SNPs) and acquired somatic
copy number aberrations (CNAs) were associated with expression in  40% of
genes, although the landscape was dominated by cis and trans-acting CNAs. By
delineating expression outlier genes driven in cis by CNAs, we identified
putative cancer genes, including deletions in PPP2R2A, MTAP, and MAP2K4.
Unsupervised analysis of paired DNA/RNA profiles revealed novel subgroups
with distinct clinical outcomes, which reproduced in the validation cohort.
These include a high-risk, ER-positive 11q13/14 cis-acting subgroup and a
favourable prognosis subgroup devoid of CNAs. Trans-acting aberration
0152hotspots were found to modulate subgroup-specific gene networks, including
a TCR deletion-mediated adaptive immune response in the 0152CNA-devoid
sub-group and a Basal-specific chromosome 5 deletion-driven mitotic network.

"Association studies using the Metabochip array - Samples analysed by the WTCCC (1958 British Birth Cohort (58BC), Hypertension cohort (HT), Type 2 Diabetes Cohort (T2D) and Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) cohort)","Genomewide association studies (GWAS) have proven a powerful hypothesis-free method to identify common disease-associated variants. Even quite large GWAS, however, have only at best identified moderate proportions of the genetic variants contributing to disease heritability. To provide cost-effective genotyping of common and rare variants to map the remaining heritability and to fine-map established loci, the Metabochip Consortium has developed a 200,000 SNP chip that has been produced in very large numbers for a fraction of the cost of GWAS chips. This chip provides a powerful tool for genetic studies of metabolic, cardiovascular and anthropometric traits (Voight et al., in press PLoS Genetics)."

Molecular Sub-grouping of CNS-PNET,"In our study we aimed to define CNS-PNET subgroups.  We performed Expression, Genotyping and/or Immunohistochemistry on 142 samples from 20 worldwide centers.  Using these techniques, we have identified three molecular subgroups with distinct expression and copy number patterns, as well as, unique clinical characteristics.  Specifically, these molecular subgroups were distinguished by primitive neural (group 1), oligoneural (group 2), and mesenchymal lineage (group 3) gene-expression signatures with differential expression of cell-lineage markers LIN28 and OLIG2.  Our report underscores the importance of concerted, collaborative efforts to study large retrospective cohorts of tumours and patients to accelerate biological and ultimately therapeutic studies of rare tumours. The outcome of such a collaboration allowed us to identify LIN28 and OLIG2  as promising diagnostic and prognostic molecular markers for CNS PNET that warrant further assessment in prospective clinical trials."

METABRIC miRNA landscape,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key players in cancer pathogenesis1. They display differential expression across breast cancer subtypes, and play oncogenic and tumor-suppressive roles2-6. A systematic study of the global miRNA landscape in breast cancer and the factors shaping it has not been undertaken. Here we report the results of profiling miRNA expression in 1,302 breast tumors with detailed clinical annotation and long-term follow-up, and for which matching genomic and mRNA expression data were available7. This provides a comprehensive view of the quantity, distribution and variation of the miRNA population and dissects how much genomic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional events contribute to miRNA expression architecture. The key clinical parameters and cellular pathways related to the miRNA landscape are identified, exemplified by context-dependent interaction with cell adhesion and Wnt signaling. Strikingly, in breast cancer miRNAs appear to act as modulators of mRNA-mRNA interactions rather than molecular switches. We demonstrate an important modulatory role for miRNAs in the biology of breast tumors devoid of somatic copy number aberrations, a common subtype where immune response is prominent. Remarkably, prognostic miRNA signatures derived in this subtype are consistently prognostic across several other subtypes and validate in external cohorts. These findings represent a new framework to study the biology of miRNA in human cancer."

The Haemgen RBC study,"Anaemia is a major determinant of global ill-health. To refine our understanding of the genetic factors influencing red blood cell formation and function, we carried out a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for six red blood cell traits: haemoglobin (HB), mean cell haemoglobin (MCH), mean cell haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), mean cell volume (MCV), packed cell volume (PCV) and red blood cell count (RBC). We provide genome-wide association results for 62,553 people of European ancestry using up to 2,644,161 autosomal SNPs. Participants with extreme measurements (>+/-3SD from mean) were excluded on a per phenotype basis. Imputation was done using haplotypes from HapMap Phase 2. SNP associations with each phenotype were tested by linear regression using an additive genetic model. Associations were tested separately in each cohort, with principal components and other study specific factors as covariates to account of population substructure. We then carried out meta-analysis of results from the individual cohorts using z-scores weighted by square root of sample size. SNPs with MAF<1% (weighted average across cohorts) were removed, as were SNPs with weight <50% of phenotype sample size.

NOWAC blood-based breast cancer case-control study,"Tumor-host interactions extend beyond the local microenvironment and cancer development largely depends on the ability of malignant cells to hijack and exploit the normal physiological processes of the host. Although abnormalities in a hostâ€™s systemic immunity are associated with increased cancer susceptibility, the functional interplay between tumor cells and circulating immune cells in regulating tumorigenic responses is unclear. We employed the Norwegian Women and Cancer study, a large prospective population-based cohort study, to identify gene expression changes in blood cells that provide a robust and reproducible diagnostic signal specific to breast cancer patients. We further show that circulating blood cells in breast cancer patients are enriched in genes involved in systemic immunosuppression and the motility, metabolism, growth, and proliferation of immune cells. By mining of the cancer-associated blood transcriptome, we identified immune mediators or biomarkers that could permit early detection of breast cancer and open avenues to novel targeted immunotherapies."

MRCA and MRCE SNP genotypes,"Gene expression levels can be an important link DNA between variation and phenotypic manifestations. Our previous map of global gene expression based on approximately 400K SNPs and 50K transcripts in 400 sib pairs from the MRCA family panel has been widely used to interpret the results of GWAS. Here, we more than double the size of our initial dataset with expression data on 550 additional individuals from the MRCE family panel using the Illumina whole genome expression array. We have used new statistical methods for dimension reduction to account for non-genetic effects in estimates of expression levels and we have also included SNPs imputed from the 1000 Genomes Project. Our methods reduced false discovery rates and increased the number of eQTLs mapped either locally or at a distance (i.e. in cis or trans) from 1,534 in the MRCA dataset to 4,452 (with <5% FDR). Imputation of 1000 Genomes SNPs further increased the number of eQTLs to 7,302. Using the same methods and imputed SNPs in the newly acquired MRCE dataset we identified eQTLs for 9000 genes. The combined results identify strong local and distant effects for transcripts from 14,177 genes. Our eQTL database (http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/faculty/liming-liang/software/eqtl/) based on these results is freely available to help define the function of disease-associated variants."

Genetic variation in Kuusamo,"The aim of this study is to characterize as completely as possible the genetic variation and structure of Kuusamo and surrounding regions. We will perform low coverage, whole genome sequencing in a relatively limited number (approximately 200) of individuals from the FINRISK study both of whose parents are born in Kuusamo, Posio or Taivalkoski. Sequencing will be performed at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI). We have previously shown using simulations and genome wide SNP data that the genetic characteristics agree with known genealogical data, and that approximately 200 individuals suffice to capture the majority of the genetic variation in this population.

We have also developed methods for long-range haplotyping and long-range imputation, which are more accurate than traditional methods. This will allow us to identify a majority of the founder haplotypes in this population. The information from the haplotypes identified in this study can be used in other studies to impute from genome-wide SNP data the full genome sequence of samples ascertained for specific phenotypes."

Identifying autosomal recessive mutations causing neurological disorders,"The objective of this study is to resequence of targeted intervals containing autosomal recessive variants causing neurological disorders in consanguineous pedigrees. Using homozygosity mapping, three intervals of very different sizes have previously been unambiguously mapped for three different neurological diseases: 2.4Mb, 8Mb and 14.3Mb in size, for Microlissencephaly, Severe Mental Retardation and Complicated hereditary spastic paraplegia respectively. This study is a pilot to assess how well custom targeted resequencing performs across a broad size range of intervals. The study design is to use a different custom capture probe set for each interval, pulldown from a single patient from each family, and sequence 1 lane using Illumina paired-reads for each sample. Candidate variants will be followed up in the families themselves, and in patients with similar phenotypes from outbred populations."
Piloting exome resequencing in consanguineous families with homozygosity mapping intervals,This pilot study aims to generate pilot data to inform future study designs in consanguineous families or inbred populations by resequencing the exome of six individuals from five families with neurodevelopmental diseases. For all of these families a single mapping interval containing the causal variant has previously been identified.

PAS Pedigrees: Identification of novel genetic variants contributing to cardiovascular disease in pedigrees with premature atherosclerosis.,"The heritability of CVD has been estimated to be between 40 and 55%. Due to the low MAF, PAS-causing mutations cannot be identified by indirect genotyping because their presence cannot be inferred from common haplotypes, as has been done successfully to uncover common risk variants by GWAS. It has been shown by Ng et al that the causative gene for rare syndromes can be unequivocally identified by sequencing the exomes of only four cases and eight controls. We expect exome sequencing to result in a high number of mutations and non-causitive coding variants."
Investigation of the genetic basis of the rare syndrome Post-Transfusion Purpura (PTP),The Post-Transfusion Pupura (PTP) syndrome although rare has severe side effects for 5-10 cases per annum in the UK as a result of transfusion. High quality DNA has been isolated from either whole blood or from cryopreserved mononuclear cells of 4 patients in order to study our postulation that the condition is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in a specific gene.
Identifying causative mutations for Thrombocytopenia with Absent Radii,"Thrombocytopenia with Absent Radii is an inherited disorder that manifests itself with major limb skeletal abnormalities and low platelet count (and therefore a bleeding diathesis). The syndrome is well-characterised and defined phenotypically and there is a well-established database of UK-based families affected with ths disorder. The causative mutation for the disorder is yet to be identified. If known, it would allow for pre-natal screening and counselling avoiding life-long care for patients who are affected and are therefore severely disabled. We postulate that exon sequencing of 4 unrelated affected individuals would give enough power to narrow down potential candidate mutations which would thereafter be confirmed using DNA from other affected families."

Screening for human epigenetic variation at CpG islands,"Many human characteristics, including susceptibility to disease, are determined genetically. An unexplored alternative to such genetic determination concerns epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation. CpG islands (CGIs) are generally constitutively hypomethylated, however there are circumstances in which they become heavily methylated and, when coincident with a gene promoter, this invariably causes transcriptional silencing. CGI methylation occurs in normal tissues during processes such as X-inactivation, but abnormal patterns of methylation have also been implicated in disease. The vast majority of evidence relates to cancer, where silencing of multiple genes in this way appears to be a causal contributor to the cancer state. To address the role and extent of CGI methylation in â€˜normalâ€™ and diseased cells we applied MBD-affinity purification in conjunction with next generation sequencing in a panel of human brain autopsy samples. These samples represent a panel of individuals as well as specific brain regions and neurological pathologies."
Functional characterisation of CpG islands in human and mouse tissues,"Tissue-specific methylation patterns suggest a role for CpG island (CGI) methylation in differentiation and cell-type-specific gene regulation. We have applied CXXC affinity purification (CAP), MBD affinity purification (MAP) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in combination with solexa sequencing to investigate the extent and functional significance of CGI methylation in sperm, blood, cerebellum and ES cells for both human and mouse."
Screening for abnormal CGI methylation in primary colorectal tumours,"A common hallmark of neoplastic cells is abnormal acquisition of CpG island (CGI) methylation and the silencing of associated gene promoters.

CRLF2 sequencing project ,"I hope to gain insight into novel genetic aberrations present in these patients that will highlight
important pathways that are involved in this subtype of leukaemia. It would be interesting to see if
the mutations and pathways that are activated are consistent between the patients, or differences
are observed dependent upon whether the patient has the translocation or the PAR1 deletion. Of
note is the high association with either numerical gains of chromosome X or numerical/structural
abnormalities of chromosome 21 (Down syndrome, iAMP21) in patients with CRLF2 deregulation. I
hope to find abnormalities linking chromosomes X and 21 to CRLF2 deregulation in BCPâ€ALL. By
including the three patients that are normal for CRLF2, but have consistent genetic abnormalities
found in the experimental cohort, I expect to find genetic differences between these two groups
that will help us to identify novel molecular targets specific to CRLF2 deregulation."

ALK inhibitors in the context of ALK dependent cancer cell lines,"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) has recently been found to be a critical cancer gene in cases of lung cancer, neuroblastomas and lymphomas. ALK inhibitors  have  recently shown significant activity in lung cancer patients with tumours that harbour the EML4-ALK gene rearrangement, but already drug-resistance is emerging. We have taken a lung cancer cell line H3122 (with the EML4-ALK rearrangement) and generated clones resistant to a small molecule inhibitor of ALK by serial exposure to the drug over 8 weeks. We now wish to characterise at the exome level whether the acquisiton of resistance has been accompanied by the development of new mutations that we can take forward for further study as the potential mechansims underlying the resistance. We therefore propose to exome sequence the parental NCI-H3122 cell line as well as drug-resistant clones."
"Linking genes, genomic instability and molecular subgroups in medulloblastoma","Brain tumors are the second most common pediatric cancer and carry the highest mortality rates in this age group. 
	Medulloblastoma is the most frequent malignant brain tumor of childhood. 
	Recent studies indicate that medulloblastoma comprises at least four sub-entities (SHH-signaling, WNT-signaling, Group-C, Group-D) that differ in molecular alterations, cell of origin, clinicopathological features and outcome. 
	Further characterization of the entire spectrum of genomic alterations underlying the formation of these distinct groups is urgently needed to identify diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for clinical management and uncover novel therapeutic targets."
Dilgom Exome,"The Finrisk sample sets are part of the National FINRISK Study. It is a large population survey on risk factors of chronic, noncommunicable diseases. The survey is carried out since 1972 every five years using independent, random and representative population samples from different parts of Finland. The main results from the previous FINRISK 2007 survey are published.
The National FINRISK Study Survey was carried out in 5 areas in Finland and 2000 inhabitants aged 25-75 years were invited to participate in each year. Among findings were that Finns continue to gain weight.
Data from FINRISK surveys are used for many different research projects and for national health monitoring needs. The recent research activities deal, in addition to cardiovascular diseases and the classical risk factors, also with e.g. asthma and allergy, alcohol, socioeconomic factors and genetic epidemiology.
The FINRISK study is part of the MORGAM Project (MONICA Risk, Genetics, Archiving and Monigraph), sponsored by the EU and MDECODE (Molecular Diversity and Epidemiology of Common Disease) program coordinated by the University of Michigan.
The exome sequencing study will be part of the Dilgom study, which is a part of the larger Finrisk population based health study performed in Finland. It consists of 5000 individuals with a prospective aspect of metabolic traits. The cohort has been extensively phenotyped for their cardiovascular and metabolic status.

Our studies will focus primarily on cardiovascular-related quantitative traits, obesity and related metabolic traits, neurodevelopmental disorders and a limited number of extreme clinical phenotypes that will provide proof-of-concept for future familial trait sequencing. We will directly analyse quantitative traits in the cohorts and the selected traits in the extreme samples, and also use imputation down to 0.1% allele frequency to extend the analyses to further sample sets with genome wide genotype data. In each case we will investigate indels and larger structural variants as well as SNPs, and use statistical methods that combine rare variants in a locus or pathway as well as single-variant approaches.

The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) is a two-generation prospective study. Pregnant women living in one of three health districts in the former county of Avon with an expected delivery date between April 1991 and December 1992 were eligible to be enrolled in the study, and this formed the initial point of contact for the development of a large, family based resource.

Information has been collected on the children and the mothers through retrieval of biological materials (e.g. antenatal blood samples, placentas), biological sampling (e.g. collection of cord blood, umbilical cord, milk teeth, hair, toenails, blood and urine), self-administered questionnaires, data extraction from medical notes, linkage to routine information systems and at repeat research clinics."
Grey Platelet Syndrome  GPS ,"As part of the Bloodomics collaboration we have several categories of pedigrees with diseases/syndromes relevant to cardiovascular diseases (CVD). One such pedigree, Grey Platelet Syndrome (GPS) is a rare congenital bleeding disorder caused by a reduction or absence of alpha granules in platelets. Exome sequencing has been performed as part of a discovery program to ascertain potential causative variants of the clinical phenotype."
Triple Negative Breast Cancer Whole Genomes,We propose to definitively characterise the somatic genetics of Triple negative breast cancer through generation of comprehensive catalogues of somatic mutations in 500 cases by high coverage genome sequencing coupled with integrated transcriptomic and methylation analyses.
Unraveling the genetic basis of a collagen migration defect in patients with a combined  platelet dysfunction and reduced bone density,"In this project we study cases from unrelated pedigrees that present at a young age with a phenotype which inludes hypotonia and hypodensity of bones, a chronic elevation of some liver and muscle enzymes as well as abnormal platelet number and volume. We aim to use exome sequencing to discover the causative variants reponsible for these defects."

Renal Follow Up Series,"This study's purpose is to use data generated in Renal whole genome and exome Cancer sequencing to target specific areas in multiple other Renal Cancer samples. These areas will then be subjected to bespoke pull downs, tagged and then pool the resultant amplicons. These amplicons will then be sequenced. This is hoped to show the prevalence of previous findings in multiple individuals in a high throughput method."
Identification of improved IL28B SNPs and haplotypes for prediction of drug response in treatment of hepatitis C using massively parallel sequencing in a cross-sectional European cohort,"The hepatitis C virus infects nearly 3% of the Worldâ€™s population, causing severe liver
disease in many. Standard of care therapy is currently pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin
(PegIFN/R), which is effective in less than half of those infected with the most common viral genotype. Two IL28B SNPs, rs8099917 and rs12979860, predict response to (PegIFN/R) therapy in treatment of hepatitis C virus infection. These SNPs were identified in genome wide analyses using Illumina genotyping chips. In people of European ancestry, there are 6 common (>1%) haplotypes for IL28B, one tagged by rs8099917 minor allele, four tagged by rs12979860.
We used massive parallel sequencing of the IL28B and IL28A gene regions generated by PCR 
from pooled DNA samples from 100 responders and 99 non-responders to therapy, to identify
common variants. Variants that had high odds ratios and were validated were then genotyped
in a cohort of 905 responders and non-responders. Their predictive power was assessed, alone
and in combination with HLA-C. Only SNPs in the IL28B linkage disequilibrium block predicted drug response. Eighteen
SNPs were identified with evidence for association with drug response, and with a high degree of confidence in the sequence call.
We found that two SNPs, rs4803221 (homozygote minor allele positive predictive value (PPV) of 77%) and rs7248668 (PPV 78%), predicted 
failure to respond better than the current best, rs8099917 (PPV 73%) and rs12979860 (PPV
68%) in this cross-sectional cohort. The best SNPs tagged a single common haplotype, haplotype 2. Genotypes predicted lack of response better than alleles.
However, combination of IL28B haplotype 2 carrier status with the HLA-C C2C2 genotype, which has previousl y
been reported to improve prediction in combination with IL28B, provides the highest PPV
(80%). The haplotypes present alternative putative transcription factor binding and
methylation sites. Massive parallel sequencing allowed identification and comparison of the best common SNPs 
for identifying treatment failure in therapy for HCV SNPs tagging a single haplotype have
the highest PPV, especially in combination with HLA-C. The functional basis for the association may be due to altered regulation of the gene.
These approaches have utility in improving diagnostic testing and identifying causal haplotypes or SNPs."

These will be based on obtaining the genome wide sequence of 4000 samples from the TwinsUK and ALSPAC cohorts (at 6x sequence coverage), and the exome sequence (protein coding regions and related conserved sequence) of 6000 samples selected for extreme phenotypes. Our studies will focus primarily on cardiovascular-related quantitative traits, obesity and related metabolic traits, neurodevelopmental disorders and a limited number of extreme clinical phenotypes that will provide proof-of-concept for future familial trait sequencing. We will analyse directly quantitative traits in the cohorts and the selected traits in the extreme samples, and also use imputation down to 0.1% allele frequency to extend the analyses to further sample sets with genome wide genotype data. In each case we will investigate indels and larger structural variants as well as SNPs, and use statistical methods that combine rare variants in a locus or pathway as well as single-variant approaches. 

This is an Irish sample set of individuals with ASD (approximately 50% with comorbid intellectual disability).

Individuals with a past or current medical disorder of probable etiological significance or TSC have been excluded. Where possible, karyotyping has been performed on one affected individual per family to exclude Fragile X syndrome. Many of the samples have been genotyped, using the Affymetrix 10k and Illumina 1M platforms. All samples to be included in the current study are of UK origin.For further information on this cohort please contact Jeremy Parr (jeremy.parr@newcastle.ac.uk)."
UK10K NEURO IMGSAC,"In the UK10K project we propose a series of complementary genetic approaches to find new low frequency/rare variants contributing to disease phenotypes. These will be based on obtaining the genome wide sequence of 4000 samples from the TwinsUK and ALSPAC cohorts (at 6x sequence coverage), and the exome sequence (protein coding regions and related conserved sequence) of 6000 samples selected for extreme phenotypes. Our studies will focus primarily on cardiovascular-related quantitative traits, obesity and related metabolic traits, neurodevelopmental disorders and a limited number of extreme clinical phenotypes that will provide proof-of-concept for future familial trait sequencing. We will analyse directly quantitative traits in the cohorts and the selected traits in the extreme samples, and also use imputation down to 0.1% allele frequency to extend the analyses to further sample sets with genome wide genotype data. In each case we will investigate indels and larger structural variants as well as SNPs, and use statistical methods that combine rare variants in a locus or pathway as well as single-variant approaches.

SCOOP is a subset of >1500 UK Caucasian patients with severe, early onset obesity (all patients have a BMI Standard Deviation Score (SDS) > 3 and obesity onset before the age of 10 years), in whom all known monogenic causes of obesity have been excluded.  GWAS data on the SCOOP cohort will be available (WTCCC2 independent study) at the time of the start of this study. Data from this cohort has demonstrated that the prevalence of the common obesity risk alleles in FTO, MC4R and NEGR1 are amongst the highest within SCOOP, demonstrating its value also in the study of genetic variants with an impact on more common obesity. For further information with regard to this cohort please contact Sadaf Farooqi (isf20@medschl.cam.ac.uk)."
UK10K OBESITY SCOOP,"In the UK10K project we propose a series of complementary genetic approaches to find new low frequency/rare variants contributing to disease phenotypes. These will be based on obtaining the genome wide sequence of 4000 samples from the TwinsUK and ALSPAC cohorts (at 6x sequence coverage), and the exome sequence (protein coding regions and related conserved sequence) of 6000 samples selected for extreme phenotypes. Our studies will focus primarily on cardiovascular-related quantitative traits, obesity and related metabolic traits, neurodevelopmental disorders and a limited number of extreme clinical phenotypes that will provide proof-of-concept for future familial trait sequencing. We will analyse directly quantitative traits in the cohorts and the selected traits in the extreme samples, and also use imputation down to 0.1% allele frequency to extend the analyses to further sample sets with genome wide genotype data. In each case we will investigate indels and larger structural variants as well as SNPs, and use statistical methods that combine rare variants in a locus or pathway as well as single-variant approaches.

Ocular coloboma is the most common significant developmental eye defect with an incidence of ~1 in 5,000 live births. It results from failure of optic fissure closure during embryogenesis. The position and extent of the fusion failure dictates the clinical appearance and functional effect. ~30% of coloboma cases are associated with other systemic malformations. These UK10K samples will mostly comprise isolated coloboma cases without systemic involvement (aka non-syndromal coloboma). There is strong evidence from family studies that coloboma has a major genetic component with autosomal dominance being the most common pattern of inheritance. However, many cases are isolated or show complex patterns of familial clustering. The genes responsible for isolated coloboma are largely unknown, but in a small number of families mutations in SHH, CHX10, and PAX6 have been identified indicating marked genetic heterogeneity. Thus in addition to the clinical benefits of achieving a molecular diagnosis there are also major scientific advantages to identifying coloboma genes, as these are likely to provide insights into the complex process of optic fissure closure, that is critical to normal eye development. In the longer term, understanding the molecular basis of the disease may provide clues to therapeutic strategies.For further information with regard to this cohort please contact David Fitzpatrick (david.fitzpatrick@ed.ac.uk)."

The clonal and mutational evolution spectrum of primary triple negative breast cancers,"Primary triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) represent approximately 16% of all breast cancers and are a tumour type defined by exclusion,for which comprehensive landscapes of somatic mutation have not been determined. Here we show in 104 early TNBC cases, that at the time of diagnosis these cancers exhibit a wide and continuous spectrum of genomic evolution, with some exhibiting only a handful of somatic aberrations in a few pathways, whereas others contain hundreds of somatic events and multiple pathways implicated. Integration with matched whole transcriptome sequence data revealed that only 36% of mutations are expressed.  By examining single nucleotide variant (SNV) allelic abundance derived from deep re-sequencing (median > 20,000 fold) measurements in 2414 somatic mutations, we determine for the first time in an epithelial tumour, the relative abundance of clonal genotypes among cases in the population. We show that TNBC vary widely and continuously in their clonal frequencies at the time of diagnosis, with basal subtype TNBC exhibiting more variation than non-basal TNBC. Although p53 and  somatic mutations appear clonally dominant compared with other pathways, in some tumours their clonal frequencies are incompatible with founder status. Mutations in cytoskeletal and cell shape/motility proteins occurred at lower clonal frequencies, suggesting they occurred later during tumour progression.  Taken together our results show that future attempts to dissect the biology and therapeutic responses of TNBC will require the determination of individual tumour clonal genotypes."

An evaluation of different strategies for large scale pooled sequencing study design ,"Second generation sequencing technology has enabled the design of large-scale sequencing experiments in targeted disease-related regions in thousands of cases and controls. Cost implications dictate a pooled DNA sequencing design, evaluation of allele frequency differences based on the resequenced samples and large-scale targeted follow-up in further samples. To evaluate the feasibility of this approach and to assess different study design strategies, we have carried out a pilot study which tests the feasibility of PCR-based and pull-down DNA pooling for (a) SNP discovery and (b) allele frequency comparison purposes. All samples are from the HapMap or 1958 BC. The sample composition of the pool is listed below: Pool 5: 31 HapMap Individuals (NA12249, NA12156, NA12004, NA11831, NA12716, NA11832, NA11993, NA12057, NA11995, NA12006, NA12144, NA12802, NA12146, NA12005, NA12003, NA07000, NA12043, NA12044, NA11992, NA11881, NA11994, NA07345, NA12154, NA06994, NA06985, NA12239, NA07022, NA07034, NA12155, NA07056, NA06993); 19 1958 BC Individuals (WTCCC88214, WTCCC88215, WTCCC88216, WTCCC88217, WTCCC88222, WTCCC88233, WTCCC88240, WTCCC88241, WTCCC88242, WTCCC88247, WTCCC88249, WTCCC88262, WTCCC88264, WTCCC88278, WTCCC88294, WTCCC88298, WTCCC88302, WTCCC88305, WTCCC88321) Some pools were carried out in duplicate to assess reproducibility.

Recurrent somatic DICER1 mutations in non-epithelial ovarian tumors,"Background: Germline truncating mutations in DICER1, an RNase III-type endoribonuclease essential for processing of microRNAs, are seen in families with the pleuropulmonary blastoma-family tumor and dysplasia syndrome; these individuals have a propensity to develop non-epithelial ovarian tumors (i.e. sex-cord stromal and germ cell tumors). Methods:  We sequenced the whole transcriptomes or exomes of 14 non-epithelial ovarian tumors and noted closely clustered mutations in the RNase IIIb domain of DICER1 in four cases.  Using Sanger sequencing, we then analyzed additional ovarian tumors for mutations in this region.  The impact of the mutations on the enzymatic activity of Dicer1 was determined using in vitro RNA cleavage assays. Results:  RNase IIIb domain DICER1 mutations were found in 30/102 non-epithelial ovarian tumors (29%), predominantly Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors (26/43, 60%), including 4/4 from individuals with germline DICER1 mutations.  The mutations were restricted to metal binding sites within the RNase IIIb catalytic centres critical for miRNA interaction and cleavage, and were somatic in all 14 cases where germline DNA was available for testing. Of 266 epithelial ovarian and endometrial cancers tested, one case, an ovarian carcinosarcoma, had a hotspot mutation.  In vitro, the mutant DICER proteins showed reduced RNase IIIb activity but retained RNase IIIa activity. Conclusions:  Somatic missense mutations of the RNase IIIb domain of DICER1 are common in non-epithelial ovarian tumors.  Genetic, pathologic, and functional evidence suggest that these mutations do not obliterate DICER1 function, rather, they alter it in specific cell types, a novel mechanism through which perturbed microRNA expression is oncogenic."

"""Targeted High Throughput Sequencing in Clinical Cancer Settings: Formaldehyde fixed-paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor tissues, input amount and tumor heterogeneity""","""Background: Massively parallel sequencing technologies have brought an enormous increase in sequencing throughput. However, these technologies need to be further improved with regard to reproducibility and applicability to clinical samples and settings. 
Methods: Using identification of genetic variations in prostate cancer as an example we address three crucial challenges in the field of targeted re-sequencing: Small nucleotide variation (SNV) detection in samples of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue material, minimal amount of input sample and sampling in view of tissue heterogeneity.
Results: We show that FFPE tissue material can supplement for fresh frozen tissues for the detection of SNVs and that solution-based enrichment experiments can be accomplished with small amounts of DNA with only minimal effects on enrichment uniformity and data variance. 
Finally, we address the question whether the heterogeneity of a tumor is reflected by different genetic alterations, e.g. different foci of a tumor display different genomic patterns. We show that the tumor heterogeneity plays an important role for the detection of copy number variations, but is of minor importance for the detection of somatic variations.
Conclusions: The application of high throughput sequencing technologies in cancer genomics opens up a new dimension for the identification of disease mechanisms. In particular the ability to use small amounts of FFPE samples available from surgical tumor resections and histopathological examinations facilitates the collection of precious tissue materials.

"""Targeted High Throughput Sequencing in Clinical Cancer Settings: Formaldehyde fixed-paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor tissues, input amount and tumor heterogeneity""","""Background: Massively parallel sequencing technologies have brought an enormous increase in sequencing throughput. However, these technologies need to be further improved with regard to reproducibility and applicability to clinical samples and settings. 
Methods: Using identification of genetic variations in prostate cancer as an example we address three crucial challenges in the field of targeted re-sequencing: Small nucleotide variation (SNV) detection in samples of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue material, minimal amount of input sample and sampling in view of tissue heterogeneity.
Results: We show that FFPE tissue material can supplement for fresh frozen tissues for the detection of SNVs and that solution-based enrichment experiments can be accomplished with small amounts of DNA with only minimal effects on enrichment uniformity and data variance. 
Finally, we address the question whether the heterogeneity of a tumor is reflected by different genetic alterations, e.g. different foci of a tumor display different genomic patterns. We show that the tumor heterogeneity plays an important role for the detection of copy number variations, but is of minor importance for the detection of somatic variations.
Conclusions: The application of high throughput sequencing technologies in cancer genomics opens up a new dimension for the identification of disease mechanisms. In particular the ability to use small amounts of FFPE samples available from surgical tumor resections and histopathological examinations facilitates the collection of precious tissue materials. However, care needs to be taken in regard to the locations of the biopsies taken, which can have an influence on the prediction of copy number variations.

Whole-exome sequencing of human pancreatic cancers and characterization of genomic instability caused by MLH1 haploinsufficiency and complete deficiency,"Whole-exome sequencing (Exome-Seq) has been successfully applied in several recent studies. We here performed Exome-Seq of 15 pancreatic tumor-normal pairs. We captured 162,073 exons of 16,954 genes and sequenced the targeted regions to a mean coverage of 56 folds. This study identified a total of 1,517 somatic mutations and validated 934 of them by transcriptome sequencing. We detected recurrent mutations in 56 genes. Among them, 41 have not been described. The mutation rates varied widely among tumors. The diversity of mutation rates was significantly correlated with the distinct MLH1 copy-number status. Exome-Seq revealed intensive genomic instability in a tumor with MLH1 homozygous deletion, indicated by a dramatically elevated mutation rate of somatic substitutions, small insertions/deletions (indels), as well as indels presented at microsatellites. Notably, we detected MLH1 allelic loss in 4 tumors. MLH1 expression was decreased by nearly half in these cases. While they were negative in the conventional microsatellite instability assay, they showed a 10.5-fold increase in the mutation rate of somatic indels, e.g. truncating indels in TP53 and TGFBR2, indicating MLH1 haploinsufficiency in correction of DNA indel errors. We further analyzed the exomes of 15 renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) and confirmed MLH1 haploinsufficiency. We observed a significant increase in the mutation rate of somatic indels in affected cases and identified recurrent truncating indels in several cancer genes such as VHL, PBRM1 and JARID1C. Together, our data suggest that MLH1 hemizygous deletion, through increasing the mutation rate of somatic indels, could drive the development and progression of sporadic cancers."

Full genome sequencing of a monozygotic twin discordant for schizophrenia,"We sequenced the genomes from a monozygotic twin discordant for schizophrenia and a tumor-normal pair of an ovarian cancer patient. Using whole-genome twin data to discriminate between correctly identified single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and errors a strategy for the accurate detection of SNVs was developed. By applying stringent sequencing quality measures, excluding error-prone regions and selecting SNVs identified by different mapping and variation calling algorithms, error rates were ~37-fold reduced. This enabled us to identify the first discordant SNVs in monozygotic twins using whole-genome sequencing. In addition, by showing that novel SNVs are highly enriched in errors, accurate estimates of the number of novel and rare SNVs occurring in unrelated Caucasian individuals were obtained. Finally, somatic mutations in coding and regulatory sequences were reliably identified in the highly rearranged ovarian tumor. Overall, our data demonstrate that strategies to reduce error rates in whole-genomes are required for disease gene discovery."

Whole genome sequencing of matched primary and metastatic acral melanomas,"Next generation sequencing has enabled systematic discovery of mutational spectra in cancer samples. Here we used whole genome sequencing to characterise somatic mutations and structural variation in a primary acral melanoma and its lymph node metastasis. Our data show that the somatic mutational rates in this acral melanoma sample pair was more comparable to the rate reported in cancer genomes not associated with mutagenic exposure than in the genome of a melanoma cell line or the transcriptome of melanoma short-term cultures. Despite the perception that acral skin is sun-protected, the dominant mutational signature in these samples is compatible with damage due to ultraviolet light exposure. A nonsense mutation in ERCC5 discovered in both the primary and metastatic tumours, could also have contributed to the mutational signature through accumulation of unrepaired dipyrimidine lesions. However, evidence of transcription-coupled repair was suggested by the lower mutational rate in the transcribed regions and expressed genes. The primary and the metastasis are highly similar at the level of global gene copy number alterations, loss of heterozygosity and single nucleotide variation (SNV). Furthermore, the majority of the SNVs in the primary tumour were propagated in the metastasis and one non-synonymous coding SNV and one splice site mutation appeared to arise de novo in the metastatic lesion."

Association of Age at Diagnosis and Genetic Mutations in Patients with Neuroblastoma,"Neuroblastoma is diagnosed over a wide age range from birth through young adulthood, and older age at diagnosis is associated with a decline in survivability. We performed whole genome sequencing of DNA from diagnostic tumors and their matched germlines from 40 patients with metastatic neuroblastoma obtained between 1987 and 2009.  To identify genetic lesions that are associated with age at diagnosis in patients with metastatic neuroblastoma. Age groups at diagnosis included infants (0-18 months), children (18 months-12 years), and adolescents and young adults (>12 years). To confirm the findings from this discovery cohort, validation testing using tumors from an additional 64 patients obtained between 1985 and 2009 was also performed.  Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue was used for immunohistochemistry and fluorescent in situ hybridization.  Telomere lengths were analyzed using the whole genome sequencing data, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and fluorescent in situ hybridization"

Exome-sequencing identifies new oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes recurrently altered in hepatocellular carcinoma,"""Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver malignancy. High-resolution copy number analysis of 125 tumors of which 24 were subjected to whole-exome sequencing identified 135 homozygous deletions and 994 somatic gene mutations with predicted functional consequences. We identified new recurrent alterations in 4 genes (ARID1A, RPS6KA3, NFE2L2 and IRF2) not previously described in HCC. Functional analyses demonstrated tumor suppressor properties for IRF2 whose inactivation, exclusively found in hepatitis B virus related tumors, leads to impaired TP53 function. Alternatively, inactivation of proteins involved in chromatin remodeling was frequent and predominant in alcohol related tumors. Moreover, activation of the oxidative stress metabolism and inactivation of RPS6KA3 were new pathways associated with WNT/beta-catenin activation, thereby suggesting a cooperative effect in tumorigenesis. This study shows the dramatic somatic genetic diversity in HCC, it reveals interactions between oncogene and tumor suppressor gene mutations markedly related to specific risk factors. """

Whole Genome Sequencing of Neuroblastoma,"Neuroblastoma is a childhood tumour of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system. The pathogenesis has for a long time been quite enigmatic, as only very few gene defects were identified in this often lethal tumour1. Frequently detected gene alterations are limited to MYCN amplification (20%) and ALK activations (7%)2-5. Here we present a whole genome sequence analysis of 87 neuroblastoma of all stages. Only few recurrent amino-acid changing mutations were found. In contrast, analysis of structural defects identified in 18% of high stage neuroblastoma a local shredding of chromosomes, known as chromothripsis6. These tumours are associated with a poor outcome. Structural alterations recurrently affected ODZ3, PTPRD and CSMD1, which are involved in neuronal growth cone stabilization7-9. In addition, ATRX, TIAM1 and a series of regulators of the Rac Rho pathway were mutated, further implicating defects in neuritogenesis in neuroblastoma. Most tumors with defects in these genes were aggressive high stage neuroblastoma, but did not carry MYCN amplifications. The genomic landscape of neuroblastoma therefore reveals two novel molecular defects, chromotripsis and neuritogenesis gene alterations, which frequently occur in high risk tumors."

UK10K NEURO GURLING,"In the UK10K project we propose a series of complementary genetic approaches to find new low frequency/rare variants contributing to disease phenotypes. These will be based on obtaining the genome wide sequence of 4000 samples from the TwinsUK and ALSPAC cohorts (at 6x sequence coverage), and the exome sequence (protein coding regions and related conserved sequence) of 6000 samples selected for extreme phenotypes. Our studies will focus primarily on cardiovascular-related quantitative traits, obesity and related metabolic traits, neurodevelopmental disorders and a limited number of extreme clinical phenotypes that will provide proof-of-concept for future familial trait sequencing. We will analyse directly quantitative traits in the cohorts and the selected traits in the extreme samples, and also use imputation down to 0.1% allele frequency to extend the analyses to further sample sets with genome wide genotype data. In each case we will investigate indels and larger structural variants as well as SNPs, and use statistical methods that combine rare variants in a locus or pathway as well as single-variant approaches. 

This sample set consists of DNA from multiply affected schizophrenia families. The families have been diagnosed using the SADS-L clinical instrument which gives diagnoses at the probable level of the research diagnostic criteria (RDC). In addition all diagnoses are available using DSMIIIR criteria. These criteria are widely accepted as being valid and reliable for the diagnosis of schizophrenia. All families have been collected to ensure that they are uni-lineal for transmission of schizophrenia, i.e. they have only one affected parent with schizophrenia, or a relative of only one transmitting or obligate carrier parent with schizophrenia. Families with bi-lineal transmission of schizophrenia (i.e. with both parents being affected) were not sampled for this study. All families have multiple cases of schizophrenia and related disorders. The families have been selected to ensure there are no cases of bipolar disorder within them and that they do not contain bipolar disorder in any relatives on either side of the family.For further information on this cohort please contact Hugh Gurling (h.gurling@ucl.ac.uk)."

Driver mutations in histone H3.3 and chromatin remodelling genes in paediatric glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a lethal brain tumour in adults and children. However, DNA copy number and gene expression signatures indicate differences between adult and paediatric cases. To explore the genetic events underlying this distinction, we sequenced the exomes of 48 paediatric GBM samples. Somatic mutations in the H3.3-ATRX-DAXX chromatin remodelling pathway were identified in 44% of tumours (21/48). Recurrent mutations in H3F3A, which encodes the replication-independent histone 3 variant H3.3, were observed in 31% of tumours, and led to amino acid substitutions at two critical positions within the histone tail (K27M, G34R/G34V) involved in key regulatory post-translational modifications. Mutations in ATRX (alpha-thalassaemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked) and DAXX (death-domain associated protein), encoding two subunits of a chromatin remodelling complex required for H3.3 incorporation at pericentric heterochromatin and telomeres, were identified in 31% of samples overall, and in 100% of tumours harbouring a G34R or G34V H3.3 mutation. Somatic TP53 mutations were identified in 54% of all cases, and in 86% of samples with H3F3A and/or ATRX mutations. Screening of a large cohort of gliomas of various grades and histologies (n=784) showed H3F3A mutations to be specific to GBM and highly prevalent in children and young adults. Furthermore, the presence of H3F3A/ATRX-DAXX/TP53 mutations was strongly associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres and specific gene expression profiles. This is, to our knowledge, the first report to highlight recurrent mutations in a regulatory histone in humans, and our data suggest that defects of the chromatin architecture underlie paediatric and young adult GBM pathogenesis."

Ethiopia Genome Project  low coverage ,"The Ethiopian area stands among the most ancient ones ever occupied by human populations and their ancestors. Particularly, according to archaeological evidences, it is possible to trace back the presence of Hominids up to at least 3 million years ago. Furthermore, the present day human populations show a great cultural, linguistic and historic diversity which makes them essential candidate to investigate a considerable part of the African variability. Following the typing of 300 Ethiopian samples on Illumina Omni 1M (see Human Variability in Ethiopia project, previously approved by the Genotyping committee) we now have a clearer idea on which populations living in the area include the most of the diversity.
This project therefore aims to sequence the whole genome of 300 individuals at low (4-8x) depth belonging to the six most representative populations of the Ethiopian area to produce a unique catalogue of variants peculiar of the North East Africa. Furthermore 6 samples (one from each population) will also be sequenced at high  (30x) depth to ensure full coverage of the diversity spectrum.

The retrieved variants will be of great help in evaluating the demographic dynamics of those populations as well as shedding light on the migrations out of Africa."

Accurate mutation detection in leukemia by re-sequencing a cancer gene set,"With the advent of whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing, high-quality catalogs of recurrently mutated cancer genes are becoming available for many cancer types. Increasing access to sequencing technology, including bench-top sequencers, provide the opportunity to re-sequence a limited set of cancer genes across a patient cohort with limited processing time. Here, we re-sequenced a set of cancer genes in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) using the Roche/454 technology coupled with Nimblegen sequence capture. First, we investigated how a maximal sensitivity and specificity of mutation detection can be achieved through a benchmark study. We tested nine combinations of different mapping and variant-calling methods, varied the variant calling parameters, and compared the predicted mutations with a large independent validation set obtained by capillary re-sequencing. We found that the combination of two mapping algorithms, namely BWA-SW and SSAHA2, coupled with the variant calling algorithm Atlas-SNP2 yields the highest sensitivity (95%) and the highest specificity (93%). Next, we applied this analysis pipeline to identify mutations in a set of 58 cancer genes, in a panel of 18 T-ALL cell lines and 15 T-ALL patient samples. We confirmed mutations in known T-ALL drivers, including PHF6, NF1, FBXW7, NOTCH1, KRAS, NRAS, PIK3CA, and PTEN. Interestingly, we also found mutations in several cancer genes that had not been linked to T-ALL before, including JAK3. Finally, we re-sequenced a small set of 39 candidate genes and identified recurrent mutations in TET1, SPRY3 and SPRY4. In conclusion, we established an optimized analysis pipeline for Roche/454 data that can be applied to accurately detect gene mutations in cancer, which led to the identification of several new candidate T-ALL driver mutations."
Identification of the underlying causal variant in a multi generational family with autosomal dominant common variable immunodeficiency,"Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the most common form of primary immunodeficiency with an estimated incidence of 1:10,000. It has been apparent for many years that CVID has a genetic component, occurs frequently in families and can have both a recessive or dominant mode of inheritance. In recent years, 4 genes underlying CVID have been identified; however, mutations within in them are estimated to account for no more than 10% of all cases of CVID.
We have identified a multi-generational family with autosomal dominant CVID. Genome-wide linkage analysis has mapped the locus underlying CVID in this family to an approximately 9.2 Mb interval on chromosome 3q27.3-q29, between the markers D3S3570 and D3S1265. This locus is distinct from any of the previously mapped susceptibility loci suggesting a novel genetic variant is responsible for disease in this family. The aim of this study is to use exome sequencing of affected (n = 4) and unaffected (n = 4) individuals, in tandem with the available genetic mapping data, to identify the causal variant underlying CVID in this family."
Comparing sequencing of four proto-typical Burkitt lymphomas (BL) with IG-MYC translocation.,"By whole-genome, exome, transcriptome and methylome sequencing of four proto-typical Burkitt lymphomas (BL) with IG-MYC translocation we identified seven recurrently mutated genes including ID3.

Stratifying and Targeting Pediatric Medulloblastoma through Genomics,
Coverage bias and sensitivity of variant calling for four whole-genome sequencing technologies,"Massively parallel sequencing has revolutionized research in cancer genetics and genomics and enhanced our understanding of natural human genetic variation. Recently, Lam et al. have performed a detailed comparison of two next-generation sequencing technologies with respect to their sensitivity to call single nucleotide variants (SNV) and indels. Here, we sequenced two tumor/normal pairs obtained from two paedriatic medulloblastoma patients with Life Technologiesâ€™ SOLiD 4 and 5500xl SOLiD, Illuminaâ€™s HiSeq2000, and Complete Genomicsâ€™ technology.  We then compared their ability to call SNVs with high confidence. As gold standard for SNV calling, we used genotypes determined by an Affymetrix SNP array. Additionally, we performed a detailed analysis of how evenly each technology covers the genome and how the reads are distributed across functional genomic regions. Finally, we studied how a combination of data from different technologies might help to overcome the limitations in SNV calling by any of the four technologies alone."
AML targeted resequencing study,"Genomic libraries will be generated from whole genome amplified  genomic DNA derived from 3,000 myeloid neoplasms.  Targeted capture will be performed by multiplexing 16 barcoded samples in each library.  Pools of 96 DNA samples will be subjected to 1-2 lanes of HiSeq 75bp sequencing. Reads will be mapped to the current build of the human reference genome to facilitate the generation of a comprehensive catalog of somatic mutations associated with 116 known myeloid and cancer driver genes."
Genetic mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapy in breast cancer,"Resistance towards chemotherapy is one of the main causes of treatment failure and death
among breast cancer patients.
The main objective of this project is to identify genetic mechanisms causing some breast
cancer patients not to respond to a particluar type of chemotherapy (epirubicin) while other
patients respond very well to the same treatment.
In the project we will perform genome / exome sequencing of a selection of breast cancer
patients (n=30). These patients are drawn from a cohort where all patients have recieved
treatment with epirubicin monotherapy before surgical removal of a locally advanced breast
tumour, and where all patients have been subjected to objective evaluation of the response to
the therapy.
Subsequent to sequencing, we will analyse the data and compare with the clinical data for
each patient (object response to therapy). The main aim being to identify mutations that are
associated with resistance to epirubicin.
Identification of mutations with strong predictive value, may have a direct impact on cancer
treatment since it opens the possibility for genetic testing of a tumour, and desicion on which
drug is likely to work best, prior to treatment start."

Validation of a Haloplex platform for targeted re sequencing of the exons of 25 genes,"We recently used the Agilent SureSelect platform to re-sequence a set of genes known to be
mutated in human AML. The results from 10 AML DNA samples were very satisfactory, but
the effort required was significant.
Thus, we decided to re-sequence the same genes using the Haloplax system for target
enrichment in 48 AML samples. We planned to do this using MiSeq and have data from a
pilot of 3 samples. The data is promising but coverage appears pathcy so far.
However, in order to get a better understanding of the data we will need deeper sequencing. We
will need two lanes of HiSeq to get the same degree coverage as Sureselect.

Genentech Colon Cancer Screen,"Identifying and understanding changes in cancer genomes is essential for the development of targeted therapeutics. Here we analyse systematically more than 70 pairs of primary human colon tumours by applying next-generation sequencing to characterize their exomes, transcriptomes and copy-number alterations. We have identified 36,303 protein-altering somatic changes that include several new recurrent mutations in the Wnt pathway gene TCF7L2, chromatin-remodelling genes such as TET2 and TET3 and receptor tyrosine kinases including ERBB3. Our analysis for significantly mutated cancer genes identified 23 candidates, including the cell cycle checkpoint kinase ATM. Copy-number and RNA-seq data analysis identified amplifications and corresponding overexpression of IGF2 in a subset of colon tumours. Furthermore, using RNA-seq data we identified multiple fusion transcripts including recurrent gene fusions involving R-spondin family members RSPO2 and RSPO3 that together occur in 10% of colon tumours. The RSPO fusions were mutually exclusive with APC mutations, indicating that they probably have a role in the activation of Wnt signalling and tumorigenesis. Consistent with this we show that the RSPO fusion proteins were capable of potentiating Wnt signalling. The R-spondin gene fusions and several other gene mutations identified in this study provide new potential opportunities for therapeutic intervention in colon cancer."

Molecular characterization of invasive lobular carcinoma,"Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is the second most common histological subtype of breast cancer accounting for 10-15% of cases. ILC differs from invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)with respect to epidemiology, histology, and clinical presentation. Moreover, ILC is less
sensitive to chemotherapy, more frequently bilateral, and more prone to form gastrointestinal, peritoneal, and ovarian metastases than IDCs. In contrast to IDC, the prognostic value of
histological grade (HG) in ILC is controversial. One of the three major components of histological grading (tubule formation) is missing in ILC which hinders the process of grading
in this histological subtype and results in the classification of approximately two thirds of ILC as HG 2.
Over the last decade, a number of gene expression signatures have shed light onto breast cancer classification, allowing breast cancer care to become more personalized. With
respect to the management of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, several gene expression signatures provide prognostic and/or predictive information beyond what is possible with current classical clinico-pathological parameters alone. Nevertheless, most studies using gene expression signature have not considered different histologic subtypes
separately. Recently, a comprehensive research program has elucidated some of the biological underpinnings of invasive lobular carcinoma. Genetic material extracted from 200 ILC tumor samples were studied using gene expression profiling and identified ILC
molecular subtypes. These proliferation-driven gene signatures of ILC appear to have prognostic significance. In particular, the Genomic Grade (GG) gene signature improved upon HG in ILC and added prognostic value to classic clinico-pathologic factors. In addition this study demonstrated that most ILC are molecularly characterized as luminal-A (~75%)followed by luminal-B (~20%) and HER2-positve tumors (~5%). Moreover, we investigated the prognostic value of known gene signatures/ gene modules in the same cohort of ILC. As a second step within the scope of this project, we aim to investigate the interactions
between somatic ILC tumor mutations to observed transcriptome findings. To this end, we aim to perform somatic mutation analysis for the ILC tumors for which Affymetrix gene expression profiling is available. To this end, we will use a gene screen assay, which specifically interrogates the mutational status of a few hundreds of cancer genes. We believe that this pioneering effort will be fundamental for a tailored treatment of ILC with
improvement in patients' outcome."

P647 Targeted resequencing project,"In collaboration with Dr Robert Semple we have identified a family harbouring an autosomal dominant variant, which leads to severe insulin resistance (SIR), short stature and facial dysmorphism. This family is unique within the SIR cohort in having normal lipid profiles, preserved adiponectin and normal INSR expression and phosphorylation. DNA is available for 7 affected and 7 unaffected family members across 3 generations. All 14 samples have been genotyped using microsatellites and the Affymetrix 6.0 SNP chip. 

Linkage analysis identified an 18.8Mb haplotype on chromosome 19 as a possible location of the causative variant. However, Exome sequencing of 3 affected and 1 unaffected family members has not identified the causative variant suggesting the possibility of an intronic or intergenic variant in this region or elsewhere in the genome. We propose to conduct whole genome sequencing of 5 members of the pedigree at a depth of 20X. The chosen samples are two sets of parents plus one member of an unaffected branch of the pedigree who shares the risk haplotype on chromosome 19. Sequencing of the two sets of parents will be used along with the genome-wide SNP data to impute 4 affected children giving an effect sample size of 6 affected individuals."
UK10K exome sequence  TWINSUK samples,"In the UK10K project we propose a series of complementary genetic approaches to find new low frequency/rare variants contributing to disease phenotypes. These will be based on obtaining the genome wide sequence of 4000 samples from the TwinsUK and ALSPAC cohorts (at 6x sequence coverage), and the exome sequence (protein coding regions and related conserved sequence) of 6000 samples selected for extreme phenotypes. Our studies will focus primarily on cardiovascular-related quantitative traits, obesity and related metabolic traits, neurodevelopmental disorders and a limited number of extreme clinical phenotypes that will provide proof-of-concept for future familial trait sequencing. We will analyse directly quantitative traits in the cohorts and the selected traits in the extreme samples, and also use imputation down to 0.1% allele frequency to extend the analyses to further sample sets with genome wide genotype data. In each case we will investigate indels and larger structural variants as well as SNPs, and use statistical methods that combine rare variants in a locus or pathway as well as single-variant approaches. These TwinsUK samples are a subset of the TwinsUK cohort samples with a BMI>=40 that will be exome sequenced by the Obesity group."

Whole-exome Sequencing Combined with Functional Genomics Reveals Novel Candidate Driver Cancer Genes in Endometrial Cancer,"Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological malignancy, with more than 280,000 cases occurring annually worldwide. Although previous studies have identified important common somatic mutations in endometrial cancer, they have primarily focused on a small set of known cancer genes and have thus provided a limited view of the molecular basis underlying this disease. Here we developed an integrated systems biology approach to identifying novel cancer genes contributing to endometrial tumorigenesis. We first performed whole-exome sequencing on 13 endometrial cancers and matched normal samples, systematically identifying somatic alterations with high precision and sensitivity. We then combined bioinformatics prioritization with high-throughput screening (including both shRNA-mediated knockdown and expression of wild type and mutant constructs) in a highly sensitive cell viability assay. Our results revealed 12 potential driver cancer genes including 10 tumor suppressor candidates (ARID1A, INHBA, KMO, TTLL5, GRM8, IGFBP3, AKTIP, PHKA2, TRPS1 and WNT11) and two oncogene candidates (ERBB3 and RPS6KC1). The results in the â€œsensorâ€ cell line were recapitulated by siRNA-mediated knockdown in endometrial cancer cell lines. Focusing on ARID1A, we integrated mutation profiles with functional proteomics in 222 endometrial cancer samples, demonstrating that ARID1A mutations frequently co-occur with mutations in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway and are associated with PI3K pathway activation. siRNA knockdown in endometrial cancer cell lines increased AKT phosphorylation supporting ARID1A as a novel regulator of PI3K pathway activity. Our study presents the first unbiased view of somatic coding mutations in endometrial cancer and provides functional evidence for diverse driver genes and mutations in this disease."

Sequencing and analysis of a South Asian-Indian personal genome,"India with over 1.3 billion people is estimated to carry three times more genetic diversity compared to Europe.  Next-generation sequencing technologies have facilitated the understanding of diversity by enabling whole genome sequencing at greater speed and lower cost.  While multiple genomes from people of European and a few of Asian descent have been sequenced, only recently a single male genome from the Indian subcontinent at sufficient depth and coverage was published.  We have in this study sequenced and analyzed the genome of a South Asian Indian female (SAIF) from the Indian state of Kerala.  We identified over 3.4 million SNPs in this genome including over 89,873 private variations.  Comparison of the SAIF genome with several published personal genomes revealed that this individual shared ~50% of the SNPs with each of these genomes.  Analysis of the SAIF mitochondrial genome showed that it is closely related to the U1a3 haplogroup which has been previously observed in Kerala.  We assessed the SAIF genome for SNPs with health and disease consequences and found that the individual was at a higher risk for multiple sclerosis and a few other diseases.   In assessing SNPs that modulate drug response we found a variation that predicts a favorable response to metformin used for treating diabetes.  SNPs predictive of adverse reaction to warfarin indicated that the SAIF individual is not at risk for bleeding if treated with typical doses of warfarin.  In addition to these, we report the presence of several other SNPs of medical relevance."

Inferring tumor genomes from peripheral blood i.e. CTCs and plasma-DNA using deep sequencing and targeted enrichment,"In this study we tested whether complex tumor genomes can be inferred from the peripheral blood (plasma DNA /CTCs) of 32 patients with stage IV colorectal carcinoma (CRC). To establish the percentage of mutated plasma DNA fragments we used 8 patient samples with different plasma DNA size distributions and KRAS mutations in their corresponding primary tumors and employed ultra-deep pyrosequencing with 3 different sequencing reaction sizes (i.e., 119 bp, 168 bp, and 323 bp). Furthermore, we used massive parallel sequencing of a panel of 68 CRC-associated genes to establish the mutation spectrum of cancer driver genes in the primary tumors, metastases, and CTCs of two colorectal cancer patients. To investigate, whether mutations found in only one CTC (â€œprivate CTC mutationsâ€) are true mutations occurring with allele frequencies below the resolution limits of current detection methods, or whether they are amplification or sequencing artifacts, we performed ultra-deep sequencing of the primary tumors, metastases, plasma DNAs and normal tissues."

Genetic landscape of pediatric Retinoblastoma,"Retinoblastoma is a pediatric cancer of the developing retina. All retinoblastomas are believed to initiate with biallelic inactivation of the RB1 gene. To identify subsequent genetic lesions in retinoblastoma, we performed whole genome sequencing of tumor and normal DNA of 4 children with retinoblastoma and one matched orthotopic xenograft. Both alleles of RB1 were inactivated in the tumor samples. 3 of the patients had sporadic retinoblastoma and one patient had inherited retinoblastoma. Overall, there were few single nucleotide changes in coding regions of the genome and some of the tumors had few chromosomal lesions. There were very few new genetic lesions in the xenograft compared to the primary tumor. These data suggest that the genome in retinoblastoma is more stable than previously believed and there are relatively few recurrent genetic lesions in known cancer pathways other than the RB1 pathway."
Genetic landscape of pediatric Medulloblastoma,"Medulloblastoma is a heterogenous disease made up of at least four distinct subtypes of disease which appear to exploit and disrupt naturally occurring developmental pathways of cellular growth and hindbrain development. To better understand the driver mutations of this disease, we performed whole genome sequencing of 37 medulloblastomas and the corresponding normal DNA of the 37 affected children treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. We have found several novel mutations which appear subtype specific. These mutations were checked for frequency in a separate tumor cohort of 56 children with medulloblastoma, also treated on the St. Jude Medulloblastoma 2003 trial, and were tested in several animal models of medulloblastoma for proof of oncogenic potential."
Genetic landscape of core-binding factor leukemia,"Pediatric de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease that can be divided into clinically distinct subtypes based on the presence of specific chromosomal abnormalities or gene alterations. One of the best characterized subtypes of AML involves leukemias with alterations of the core-binding factor (CBF)-complex, which comprises the FAB subtypes M2 and M4Eo and associates with a favorable outcome. Patients with the AML M2 subtype harbor a translocation between chromosomes 8 and 21 [t(8;21)] that yields the chimeric fusion gene RUNX1(AML1)-RUNX1T1(ETO), while patients with AML M4Eo express the chimeric fusion gene CBFÎ²-SMMHC(MYH11) as a result of an inversion/translocation event of chromosome 16 [inv(16)/t(16;16)]. In an effort to define the total complement of genetic changes in CBF-leukemia, we performed paired-end whole genome sequencing (WGS) on diagnostic leukemia blasts and matched germ line samples from 17 pediatric CBF-leukemia patients using the Illumina platform. Somatic alterations, including single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and structural variations (SVs), including insertions, deletions, inversions, and inter- and intra-chromosomal rearrangements, were detected using complementary analysis pipelines (Bambino, CREST and CONSERTING). Recurrent screening of identified mutations will be performed in a cohort of approximately 94 cases of CBF-leukemias."
The genomic architecture of mesothelioma ,"The genome-wide landscape of somatically acquired mutations in mesothelioma has not been deeply characterised to date, but advances in DNA sequencing technology now allow this to be addressed comprehensively.

In addition, using paired-end sequencing, we will map copy number changes and genomic rearrangements from the same patients."

Assessment of genetic and epigenetic variation in human IPS cells RNA,"n order to progress human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) towards the clinic, several outstanding questions must be addressed. It is possible to reprogram different somatic cell types into hiPSCs  and from studies in the mouse, it appears that an epigenetic memory of the starting cell type is carried over to hiPSCs. However a comprehensive comparative study of the characteristics of these hiPSCs has been missing from the literature. Importantly studies which aimed to address these aspects of hiPSCs have used cells from different patients. In order to avoid this important confounding variable and to keep the genetic background constant, tissue samples were procured from the patients and reprogrammed to iPS cells. The transcriptomes of these iPS cells will be compared.
Protocol: primary cultures of cells were reprogrammed to iPS cells. RNA was extracted using a standard column extraction kit."
Integrated genomic analyses identify ARID1A and ARID1B alterations in the childhood cancer neuroblastoma,"Neuroblastomas are tumors of peripheral sympathetic neurons and are the most common solid tumor in children.   To determine the genetic basis for neuroblastoma we performed whole-genome sequencing (6 cases), exome sequencing (16 cases), genome-wide rearrangement analyses (32 cases), and targeted analyses of specific genomic loci (40 cases) using massively parallel sequencing.    On average each tumor had 19 somatic alterations in coding genes (range, 3-70).  Among genes not previously known to be involved in neuroblastoma, chromosomal deletions and sequence alterations of chromatin remodeling genes, ARID1A and ARID1B, were identified in 8 of 71 tumors (11%) and were associated with early treatment failure and decreased survival.  Using tumor-specific structural alterations, we developed an approach to identify rearranged DNA fragments in sera, providing personalized biomarkers for minimal residual disease detection and monitoring.  These results highlight dysregulation of chromatin remodeling in pediatric tumorigenesis and provide new approaches for the management of neuroblastoma patients.

"Cancer genome scanning in plasma: detection of tumor-associated copy number aberrations, single nucleotide variants and tumoral heterogeneity by massively parallel sequencing","Tumor-derived DNA can be found in the plasma of cancer patients. We explored the use of shotgun massively parallel sequencing of plasma DNA obtained from cancer patients to scan a cancer genome noninvasively. We achieved the profiling of copy number aberrations and point mutations, in a genomewide manner using this approach. By measuring the genomewide aggregated allelic loss and point mutations, we determined the fractional tumor-derived DNA concentrations in plasma and correlated these values with tumor size and surgical treatment. We have also demonstrated the application of this approach to monitoring a complex oncologic scenario, in a patient with two synchronous cancers. In particular, through the use of multi-regional sequencing of tumoral tissues and shotgun sequencing of plasma DNA, we have shown that plasma DNA sequencing is a valuable approach for studying tumoral heterogeneity. Shotgun plasma DNA sequencing is thus a powerful tool for cancer monitoring and research."

Genetic landscape of non-Down syndrome acute megkaryoblastic leukemia,"To define the mutation spectrum in non-Down syndrome acute megkaryoblastic leukemia (non-DS-AMKL), we performed transcriptome sequencing on diagnostic blasts from 14 pediatric patients and validated our findings in a recurrency/validation cohort consisting of 34 pediatric and 28 adult AMKL leukemia samples. Our analysis identified a cryptic chromosome 16 inversion [inv(16)(p13.3q24.3)] in 27% of pediatric cases, which encodes a CBFA2T3-GLIS2 fusion protein. Expression of CBFA2T3-GLIS2 in Drosophila and murine hematopoietic cells induced bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling, and resulted in a marked increase in the self-renewal capacity of hematopoietic progenitors. These data suggest that expression of CBFA2T3-GLIS2 directly contributes to leukemogenesis."
GEenetic landscape of hypodiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"Hypodiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an aggressive leukemia characterized by aneuploidy and poor outcome. The genetic basis of hypodiploid ALL is unknown. Here, using complementary genome-wide profiling approaches, we show that hypodiploid ALL comprises two subtypes that differ in the severity of aneuploidy, transcriptional profile and submicroscopic genetic alterations. Near haploid cases with 24-31 chromosomes frequently harbor alterations targeting receptor tyrosine kinase- and Ras signaling (71%) and IKZF3 (AIOLOS; 13%). In contrast, low hypodiploid ALL cases with 32-39 chromosomes are characterized by TP53 alterations, almost half of which are present in non-tumor cells, and have alterations of IKZF2 (HELIOS; 53%) and RB1 (41%). Both near haploid and low hypodiploid tumors exhibit activation of Ras and PI3K signaling pathways, and are sensitive to PI3K inhibition, indicating that these drugs should be explored as a new therapeutic strategy for this frequently lethal form of leukemia."

Integrative genomic analyses reveal androgen-driven somatic alteration landscape in early-onset prostate cancer,"Early-onset prostate cancer (EO-PCA) represents the earliest clinical manifestation of prostate cancer. To compare the genomic alteration landscapes of EO-PCA with ""classical"" (elderly-onset) PCA, we performed deep sequencing-based genomics analyses in eleven tumors diagnosed at young age, and pursued comparative assessments with seven elderly-onset PCA genomes. Remarkable age-related differences in structural rearrangement (SR) formation became evident, suggesting distinct disease pathomechanisms. Whereas EO-PCAs harbored a prevalence of balanced SRs, with a specific abundance of androgen-regulated ETS gene fusions including TMPRSS2:ERG, elderly-onset PCAs displayed primarily non-androgen-associated SRs. Data from a validation cohort of >10,000 patients showed age-dependent androgen receptor levels and a prevalence of SRs affecting androgen-regulated genes, further substantiating the activity of a characteristic ""androgen-type"" pathomechanism in EO-PCA."

Targeted sequencing of genes recurrently mutated in AML,"Background Massively parallel sequencing technology has transformed cancer genomics. It is now feasible, in a clinically relevant time-frame, for a clinically manageable cost, to screen DNA from patient tumours for mutations essentially genome-wide. The challenge for personalised medicine will be to increase the sample size to thousands or tens of thousands of well-characterised cases in order to attain sufficient statistical power to stratify patients accurately across the complexity and genomic heterogeneity expected for most of the common tumour types. Currently, whole genome sequencing on this scale is not feasible, and targeted sequencing of relevant portions of the genome will be required. Pilot data We have developed protocols for large-scale, multiplexed sequencing of 100-200 genes in thousands of samples. Essentially, using robotic technology, genomic DNA from the cancer specimen is processed into sequencing libraries with unique DNA barcodes, thereby allowing sequencing reads to be attributed to the sample they derive from. Currently, these sequencing libraries can be generated in a 96-well format using fully automated protocols, and we are exploring methods to expand this to a 384-well format. The sequencing libraries are pooled and hybridized to custom sets of RNA baits representing the genomic regions of interest. Sequencing of the pulled-down libraries is done in pools of 48-96 samples per lane of an Illumina Hi-Seq. This protocol is already implemented at the Sanger Institute. We have published proof that somatic mutations in novel cancer genes can be identified from exome-wide sequencing. In unpublished pilot data, we have established the feasibility of robotic library production, custom pull-down, and multiplexed sequencing of barcoded libraries for 100 known myeloid cancer genes across 760 myelodysplasia samples. Highlights of the data thus far analysed reveal that the coverage is remarkably even between samples; when 96 samples are run, average coverage per lane of sequencing is ~250, with 90-95% of targeted exons covered by >25 reads; known mutations can be discovered in the data set; and the protocol is amenable to whole genome amplified DNA. The bioinformatic algorithms for identification of substitutions and indels in pull-down data are well-established; we have pilot data proving that copy number changes, LOH and genomic rearrangements in specific regions of interest can also be identified by tiling of baits across the relevant loci. Proposal We propose to apply this methodology to 10000 samples from patients with AML enrolled in clinical trials over the last 10-20 years. Oncogenic point mutations and potentially genomic rearrangements will be identified, and linked to clinical outcome data, with a view to undertaking the following sorts of analyses: â€¢ Identification of co-occurrence, mutual exclusivity and clusters of driver mutations. â€¢ Correlation of prognosis with driver mutations and potentially gene-gene interactions â€¢ Exploration of genomic markers of drug response Ultimately, we would like to be in a position to release the mutation data together with matched clinical outcome data to genuine medical researchers via a controlled access approach, possibly within the COSMIC framework (www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/). The vision here is to generate a portal whereby a clinician faced with an AML patient and his / her mutational profile can obtain a â€˜personalisedâ€™ prediction of outcome, together with a fair assessment of the uncertainty of the estimate. With a sufficient sample size, there would also be the potential to develop decision support algorithms for therapeutic choices based on such data."
The Cardiogenics study,"Cardiogenics is an European collaborative project, it started in January 2007 and was funded by the European Commission through its Sixth Framework Program (reference LSHM -CT-2006-037593) until 2011. It involved several laboratories from France (INSERM UMRS937), Germany (LÃ¼beck University; Regensburg University), United Kingdom (the Welcome Trust Sanger Institute; University of Leicester) and Sweden (Uppsala University Hospital) and was coordinated by a management group composed of scientists from these different institutions. Under the coordination of the management group the laboratories are still developing projects using Cardiogenics data sets.  As part of the Cardiogenics project, RNA from monocytes and macrophages of 363 patients with coronary artery disease and 395 healthy individuals was prepared and genome-wide expression was assessed in both cell types using the Illumina HumanRef 8 v3 Beadchip .  The DNA of all these individuals was genotyped using the Human 610 Quad custom arrays. Both data sets were used to conduct eQTL analyses. A subsample of subjects included in an allelic-imbalance substudy were also genotyped using the Illumina Human Custom 1.2M array. Detailed description of these datasets can be found in Shah S et al.

Noninvasive prenatal molecular karyotyping from maternal plasma,"Fetal DNA is present in the plasma of pregnant women. Massively parallel sequencing of  maternal plasma DNA has been used to detect fetal trisomies 21, 18, 13 and selected sex  chromosomal aneuploidies noninvasively. Case reports describing the detection of fetal  microdeletions from maternal plasma using massively parallel sequencing have been reported.  However, these previous reports were either polymorphism-dependent or used statistical  analyses which were confined to one or a small number of selected parts of the genome. In  this report, we reported a procedure for performing noninvasive prenatal karyotyping at 3 Mb  resolution across the whole genome through the massively parallel sequencing of maternal  plasma DNA. This method has been used to analyze the plasma obtained from 6 cases. In 5  cases, fetal microduplications or microdeletions have been detected successfully from maternal  plasma. The two cases with fetal microduplications represented the first noninvasive prenatal  detection of such changes from maternal plasma. In the remaining case, the plasma DNA  sequencing result was consistent with the pregnant mother being a carrier of a microduplication.  Simulation analyses were performed for determining the number of plasma DNA molecules that  would need to be sequenced and aligned for enhancing the diagnostic resolution of noninvasive  prenatal karyotyping to 2 Mb and 1 Mb. In conclusion, noninvasive prenatal molecular  karyotyping from maternal plasma by massively parallel sequencing is feasible and would  enhance the diagnostic spectrum of noninvasive prenatal testing."

"Cell-type, allelic and genetic signatures in the human pancreatic beta cell transcriptome","Pancreatic beta cells within the islets of Langerhans are centrally involved in the pathogenesis of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Describing the differentiated state of the human beta cell has been hampered so far by technical (low resolution microarrays) and biological limitations (whole islet preparations rather than isolated beta cells). We circumvent these by deep RNA sequencing of purified beta cells from 11 individuals, presenting here the first characterization of the human beta cell transcriptome. Additionally, we perform the first comparison of gene expression profiles between beta cells, whole islets (N=7) and beta cell depleted islet preparations (N=5), revealing thus beta cell specific expression signatures. Finally, we combine this with whole-genome sequencing data for 7 of our donors, describing here the first set of genetic variants controlling inter-individual variability in beta cell gene expression."
Passive and active DNA methylation and the interplay with genetic variation in gene regulation,"DNA methylation is an essential1 epigenetic mark whose role in gene regulation and its dependency on genomic sequence and environment are not yet fully understood2,3. In this study we provide novel insights into the mechanistic relationships between genetic variation, DNA methylation and transcriptome sequencing data in three different cell-types of the GenCord human population cohort4. We find that the association between DNA methylation and gene expression variation among individuals are likely due to different mechanisms from those establishing methylation-expression patterns during differentiation. Furthermore, cell-type differential DNA methylation may delineate a platform in which more local inter-individual changes may respond to or act in gene regulation. We show that unlike genetic regulatory variation, DNA methylation alone does not significantly drive allele specific expression.. Finally, inferred mechanistic relationships using genetic variation as well as correlations with TF abundance reveal both a passive and active role of DNA methylation to regulatory interactions influencing gene expression."

Germline Aberrations of PAX5 Cause Susceptibility to pre-B cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,"A novel heterozygous germline variant, c.547G>A (p.Gly183Ser), in the paired box protein encoding gene, PAX5, was found to segregate with disease in two unrelated kindreds with autosomal dominant pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Leukemic cells from both families exhibited 9p deletion, with loss-of-heterozygosity and retention of the mutant PAX5 allele at 9p13 . Two additional sporadic ALL cases with 9p loss demonstrated PAX5 Gly183 substitution in the leukemic cells. Functional analysis of the PAX5 germline variants demonstrated reduced transcriptional activity, as well as decreased interaction with Groucho-4. These data extend the role of PAX5 alterations in the pathogenesis of pre-B ALL, and implicate PAX5 in a novel syndrome of germline susceptibility to pre-B cell neoplasia."
The landscape of somatic mutations in epigenetic regulators across 1000 pediatric cancer genomes,"To define the frequency and pattern of somatic mutations in epigenetic regulators in pediatric cancer, we sequenced 633 genes, encoding the majority of proteins involved in patterning the epigenome, in 1000 pediatric tumors spanning 21 different cancer subtypes. This analysis establishes an epigenetic landscape of pediatric cancer, which expands the knowledge for potential therapeutic targets and for developing personalized therapy."
Plasma-Seq of patients with metastatic prostate cancer,"Study 1 In this study we analysed patients with metastatic prostate cancer to scan their tumor genomes noninvasively in plasma DNA. We wanted to make whole-genome analysis from plasma DNA amenable to clinical routine applications and developed an approach based on a benchtop high-throughput platform, i.e. Illuminas MiSeq instrument. We performed whole-genome sequencing from plasma at a shallow sequencing depth to establish a genome-wide copy number profile of the tumor at low costs within 2 days. The genome-wide profiling in the plasma of our patients revealed multiple copy number aberrations including those previously reported in prostate tumors, such as losses in 8p and gains in 8q. High-level copy number gains in the AR locus were observed in patients with CRPC but not with CSPC disease. We identified the TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement associated 3-Mbp deletion on chromosome 21 and found corresponding fusion plasma fragments in these cases. In an index case multiregional sequencing of the primary tumor identified different copy number changes in each sector, suggesting multifocal disease. Our plasma analyses of this index case, performed 13 years after resection of the primary tumor, revealed novel chromosomal rearrangements, which were stable in serial plasma analyses over a 9 months period, which is consistent with the presence of one metastatic clone.  Our approach provides specific genomic signatures within 2 days which may therefore serve as â€œliquid biopsyâ€."

Negligible impact on missing heritability of autoimmune-locus rare coding-region variants,"Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified common variants of modest effect size at hundreds of loci for common autoimmune diseases - however a substantial fraction of heritability remains unexplained, and to which rare variants may contribute.  To discover rare variants and test them for association with a phenotype, the majority of studies re-sequence a small initial sample size and then genotype the discovered variants in a larger sample set. This approach will fail to analyse a large fraction of the rare variants present in the entire sample set. Here we perform simultaneous amplicon sequencing-based variant discovery and genotyping for coding exons of 25 GWAS risk genes in 41,911 white-European origin UK subjects comprising 24,892 subjects with six autoimmune disease phenotypes and 17,019 controls, and show that rare coding-region variants at known loci play a negligible role in common autoimmune disease susceptibility. These results do not support the rare variant - synthetic genome-wide association hypothesis. Many known autoimmune disease risk loci contain multiple independent common and low frequency variant association signals, and so genes in these loci are a priori stronger candidates to harbor rare coding-region variants than other genes. Our data suggest that the missing heritability for common autoimmune diseases may not lie in the rare coding-region variant portion of the allelic spectrum, but perhaps as others have proposed in very many common variant signals of weak effect."
Whole genome and transcriptome analysis of a sporadic and recurring parathyroid carcinoma,"Parathyroid carcinoma is an extremely rare endocrine malignancy with an estimated incidence of less than 1 per million population. Excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone, extremely high serum calcium level and the deleterious effects of hypercalcemia are the clinical manifestations of the disease. Up to 60% of patients develop multiple disease recurrences and although long-term survival is possible with palliative surgery, permanent remission is rarely achieved. Molecular drivers of sporadic parathyroid carcinoma have remained largely unknown. Previous studies, mostly based on familial cases of the disease, suggested a potential role for the tumor suppressor MEN1 and proto-oncogene RET in benign parathyroid tumorigenesis while the tumor suppressor HRPT2 and proto-oncogene CCND1 may also act as drivers in parathyroid cancer. Here, we report the complete genomic analysis of a sporadic and recurring parathyroid carcinoma. Mutational landscapes of the primary and recurrent tumor specimens were analyzed using high throughput sequencing technologies. Such molecular profiling allowed for identification of somatic mutations never previously identified in this malignancy. These included single nucleotide point mutations in well characterized cancer genes such as mTOR, MLL2, CDKN2C and PIK3CA. Comparison of acquired mutations in patient-matched primary and recurrent tumors revealed loss of PIK3CA activating mutation during the evolution of the tumor from the primary to the recurrence. Structural variations leading to gene fusions and regions of copy loss and gain were identified at a single-base resolution. Loss of short arm of chromosome 1 along with somatic mis-sense and truncating mutations in CDKN2C and THRAP3, respectively, provide new evidence for the potential role of these genes as tumor suppressors in parathyroid cancer. The key somatic mutations indentified in this study can serve as novel diagnostic markers as well as therapeutic targets."
Sequencing component for the whole genome methylation analysis in PBMCs and cell subsets  pilot study ,"DNA methylation has been shown to play a major role in determining cellular phenotype by regulating gene expression. Moreover, dysregulation of differentially methylated genes has been implicated in disease pathogenesis of various conditions including cancer development as well as autoimmune diseases such as systemic Lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. Evidence is rapidly accumulating for a role of DNA methylation in regulating immune responses in health and disease. However, the exact mechanisms remain unknown. The overall aim of the project is to investigate the role of epigenetic mechanisms in regulating immunity and their impact on autoimmune disease pathogenesis.
The aim of this pilot study is to perform whole genome methylation analysis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and cell subsets (CD4, CD8, CD14, CD19, CD16 and whole PBMCs) obtained from 6 healthy volunteers. Whole genome methylation analysis will be performed using two methodological approaches, the Infinium Methylation Bead Array K450 (Illumina) and MeDIP-seq. mRNA expression arrays will also be performed in order to correlate DNA methylation with gene expression as well as genotyping on the Illumina OmniExpress chip"
Assessment of genetic and epigenetic variation in human IPS cells,"In order to progress human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) towards the clinic, several outstanding questions must be addressed. It is possible to reprogram different somatic cell types into hiPSCs  but it is unlcear whether some cell types carry through fewer mutations through reprogramming (either due to mutations present in the primary cells, or mutations accumulated during reprogramming). Through in depth analysis of hiPSCs generated from different somatic cells, it will be possible to assess the variation in genetic stability of different cell types."

Chromosome Y Philogeny in Sardinia,"Genetic variation within the male specific portion of the Y chromosome (MSY) can clarify the origins of contemporary populations, but previous studies were hampered by partial genetic information. Population sequencing of 1,204 Sardinian males identified 11,763 MSY single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), of which 6,751 have not previously been observed. We constructed a MSY phylogenetic tree containing all main haplogroups found in Europe along with many Sardinian-specific lineage clusters within each haplogroup. The tree was calibrated with archaeological data from the initial expansion of the Sardinian population ~7,700 years ago. The ages of nodes highlight different genetic strata in Sardinia and reveal presumptive timing of  coalescence with other human populations. We calculate a putative age for coalescence of ~180-200,000 years ago, consistent with previous mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) based estimates."
Landscape of gene mutations in Down syndrome-related myeloid disorders,"To identify the spectrum of gene mutations in Down syndrome-related myeloid disorders, whole genome sequencing of 4 trio samples from TAM/AMKL/complete remission (CR) phases and whole exome sequencing of 15 TAM and 14 DS-AMKL samples were performed."
Reference epigenomes generated as part of the International Human Epigenomics Consortium (IHEC),"The term epigenome refers to chemical modifications of DNA and proteins that control genome (a term referring to all the DNA within our cells) structure and activity. In contrast to the genome, which remains mostly the same throughout an individuals life, the epigenome changes during development and aging, in response to various external stimuli and as diseases emerge. Epigenome changes can result in profound changes in which genes are turned on and hence how cells behave. Thus, an understanding of what epigenome states exist in different cell types and how these states are specified are critically important to many aspects of human health and disease. We propose to build on our internationally leading experience in epigenome mapping to establish a major Canadian centre of epigenome analysis that will demonstrate an ability to deliver complete reference epigenome information on a full spectrum of normal and diseased human cell types; to improve the technology for broader applications in the future; and to make this technology rapidly available to Canadian scientists. To accomplish this goal we have developed an integrated program with internationally recognized biologists and clinicians with specialized access to, and knowledge of, the normal and diseased cell types we will analyze. This collaborative team effort will transform our understanding of the relationship between epigenome modifications and how genes are turned on or turned off, and lay the foundation for larger studies to revolutionize our understanding of how diseases develop and how to anticipate and treat them more effectively."
Reference epigenomes generated as part of the International Human Epigenomics Consortium (IHEC),"The term epigenome refers to chemical modifications of DNA and proteins that control genome (a term referring to all the DNA within our cells) structure and activity. In contrast to the genome, which remains mostly the same throughout an individuals life, the epigenome changes during development and aging, in response to various external stimuli and as diseases emerge. Epigenome changes can result in profound changes in which genes are turned on and hence how cells behave.
